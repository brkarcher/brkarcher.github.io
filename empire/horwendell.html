	<body><h2>Horwendell</h2>

<p>A ghost with the corporeal body of an owl who introduced himself as Horwendell in the tomb where the party interrupted the Mandarin-Wight's ritual.</p>

<p>Like other ghosts, he doesn't seem to be visible or audible to anyone but the party. Unlike some, he appears to be fully aware of his condition and his surroundings, and he does seem fully corporeal.</p>

<p>He has shown considerable reluctance in talking about his natural life and death, but he has divulged some things to the party. In life, he was an arcanist of considerable skill, and in his dying months, he was hastily attempting to plumb the mysteries of Transmutation and Necromancy on behalf of some third party, hoping to learn how to provide a new body for a deserving soul. Unable to finish in time, he picked up the scraps of his work and applied it to himself, remaining on Materia as a ghostly owl, hoping to find some way to complete his work before departing.</p>
