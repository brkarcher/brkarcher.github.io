	<body><h2>Baishen</h2>

<p>A city in the Uplands, on the western frontier of the Empire. Taken in the Empire's conquests in the 1750s. Sacked and depopulated by wights in the fifth moon of 1794 YE. The seeming target of this invasion was its fortress, which held a tomb ripe for the wights to exploit for bodies.</p>

<p>The people of the uplands are culturally and linguistically distinct from the empire's heartland.</p>
