	<body><h2>V. Ki-Rin Ridge</h2>

<p>Last session, the party scaled the mountains at the south end of the Dibang Valley, seeking an abandoned palace that was once home to the legendary Ki-Rin that the mountain range is named after. From the vantage point offered by that palace, they would be able to see the approach to the southern pass into the valley, for miles in either direction. From there, they would be able to determine if a horde of undead was truly converging on the valley.</p>

<p>Their climb was interrupted as they passed the cavernous home of Yi Yan, a grouchy cyclops who was afraid the party was creeping on his goats. After the two parties exchanged a few lumps and resolved their misunderstanding, Yi Yan waved them along on their way. He also told them that he had been instructed not just to protect his goats, but to obstruct the path from any intruders by his friend, which he described as a very large... goat-cat. Perhaps he was describing the Ki-Rin? But the Ki-Rin hasn't been seen for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The party finally reached the palace, but quickly determined that it was not quite abandoned—it was swarming with wights, under the command of a rotting, undead giant, which had apparently busied itself hanging a felled tree from the ceiling of the main pavilion to use as a battering ram against a set of doors leading further within. They skirted around the giant and fell upon some of the wights holding out in a tower that was strangely devoid of breathable air (and as a result eerily silent), and then they entered the main pavilion and felled several of the wights, driving the giant and a few of his attendants out with holy energy.</p>

<p>Currently, the party stands alone in the main pavillion, gathering their strength and preparing for the return of the giant.</p>

<hr />

<p>The party barricaded the great doors to the ancient Ki-Rin palace and took their positions. The undead giant blew his war horn and charged the front with his cadre of wights while the remaining wights in the east tower thundered across the rope bridge.</p>

<p>A minute later, the dust settled, and the party was victorious.</p>

<p>They took some time to explore the rest of the palace. Climbing atop the east tower, they found the vantage point they came for, overlooking the southern pass into the Dibang Valley. The forests blanketing the foothills were flecked with fires. The party fears that this is indeed a wight invasion, one with raised firestarters of some sort... or perhaps the party's old nemesis, the undead dragonborn.</p>

<p>They magically relayed this intelligence to Lónghua, receiving a thanks and a simple set of orders in return: "Very good. Lóngzhi's orders come first. Help if you can."</p>

<p>Before leaving, they indulged in their curiosity and managed to open the last set of doors in the palatial residence by lighting two torches: one suffocating in a room with no air, and one being chilled by a constant flow of air. Inside, they found... Fuema, wearing much more luxurious clothing than when previously encountered, and offering tea.</p>
