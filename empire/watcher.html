	<body><h2>The Watcher</h2>

<p>A guardian inhabiting the eastern subterranean ruins in the Dibang Valley, entrusted with the protection of the entrance to Durad-Om.</p>

<p>The Watcher is a sort of creature known to the loremasters as a Spectator, a lesser type of Beholder, bound in protect a place or thing specified by the arcanist who summons it by way of a complicated and demanding ritual.</p>

<p>The Watcher claims to have watched over Durad-Om for at least four centuries, having been summoned to the duties by the Iorvethen.</p>

<p>The years have been lonely and difficult, and the Watcher had become quite eccentric indeed by the time the party met and defeated him in the Sixth Moon of 1794 YE.</p>
