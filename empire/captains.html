	<body><h2>The Immortal Captains</h2>

<p>The legend of the Immortal Legion is that Emperor Jin-Mao Huang raised a legion of scarecrows from a field to defeat the Hinlan tribesmen and their fearsome warlocks in battle, and those straw men formed the first Immortal Legion. The truth is that the first Immortal Legion was composed of men and women of flesh and blood, made immortal by the divine magic of the emperor.</p>

<p>The price of immortality was dear. Their mortal minds were twisted, bent, and then broken by centuries of both the glories and the terrors of war, and finally, they went mad. Their legion was broken at the Battle of Secret Falls in 221 YE, and each of them individually fought their way out of the carnage and escaped, scattering to remote corners of the empire.</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Li Su, knight and commander  </li>
<li>Guan Jinping, swordsman  </li>
<li>Meditative Nuan, arcanist  </li>
<li>The Tortoise, soldier  </li>
<li>Lu Song, duelist  </li>
<li>Tao Zemin, empty-hand artist  </li>
<li>Tang Luoyang, arcanist  </li>
</ul>
