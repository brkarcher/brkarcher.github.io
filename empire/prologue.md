## Prologue

After a two week journey, the Pyre team arrived in [Baishen](baishen.html). They had been ordered to determine how the wights sacked the town and how many it took. They found their first clues in the wreckage of the village: wights, playing dead. They dispatched them quickly and moved north to investigate a small shrine to a wind spirit. In it crouched the shrine's [keeper](haicho.html), who lashed out at them, cornered, but was talked out of it before any serious wounds were inflicted. He indicated to the party that the wind spirit was on the loose, and that the wights were led by some sort of hooded figure.

The party made a detour to the caves in the southern cliff face, encountering the wind spirit, and allowing discretion to be the better part of valor, leaving the wind spirit to its cave. Finally, then, they mounted an assault on the fortress itself. They dislodged its undead defenders and fought down to find an ancient crypt, unearthed and being lorded over by a robed, [undead Mandarin](mw.html), conducting a ritual.

The party interrupted the ritual, which knocked everyone out. They come to, now, sore, and mostly alone, but for one, [tiny feathery friend](horwendell.html), chattering with them as they collect their thoughts.
