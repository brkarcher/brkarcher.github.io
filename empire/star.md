## The Fallen Star

A mute Red Knight who bled smoke instead of blood stood over a corpse in the Dibang Valley. He seemed to wear the armor and regalia of the Immortal Legion, and he held a tiny, glimmering Starstone. When slain, a tiefling appeared, warning the party to handle the stone carefully and offering to help them unlock its power.

Later, after defeating a demon and releasing a trio of elven ghosts from their vigil over it, the starstone flared as the ghosts vanished.

The party returned to Fuema at her home beneath the birch to ask for her help. After a few hours of careful examination, she revealed to the party that it would be safe for them to handle the stone, but only them. Anybody unable to see the dead who tried to handle the stone may find themselves dead.

Having done that, their next step was to search the night sky for the starstone's companion. Fuema proclaimed it to be lucky indeedâ€”the starstone seemed to twinkle along with Xi-Kan, a northern star that is visible in all seasons at these latitudes, and bright enough to be visible even during a full moon. Xi-Kan is associated with transcendence, moving beyond, seeking, and transitioning.

Fuema asked, in return, for the party to share their discoveries with her.

Guan Yu was able to use the Starstone to open a portal to Sanctuary, a settlement in the underworld tended to by a Steward and sheltering several ghosts whom the party has freed of their mortal shackles.

* Who is Fuema, and why really has she offered to help the party with the Starstone?  
* What is the nature of Sanctuary and its Steward? How are souls called there, and what awaits them?  
* What further power might the Startstone contain?
