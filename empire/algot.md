## Algot the Shield

A nearly three-millennia-old dwarf who was a Lieutenant of a dwarven division fighting against the demon hordes of the Lord of Agony. He served under Captain Urrenhada until Urrenhada led the division into an ambush and to their deaths. As a result of the foulness of the betrayal and the direness of their fight, many of the soldiers haunt the site of the ambush as restless souls, including the diligent and sincere Algot.

Left for the afterlife in the Fifth Moon of 1794 YE after the party assisted him in vanquishing Urrenhada for good.
