	<body><h2>Statue of a Human Woman</h2>

<p>A shockingly lifelike statue found atop one of the stone altars in the chapel of Urrenhada's Treachery. Portrays a human woman wearing sturdy leathers with a knife on her belt, sitting, her head glancing at something over her left shoulder.</p>

<p>The Pyre Team suspects her to be a victim of the basilisk that laired in the mountainhome.</p>
