## Spear of the Mithral Flank

An ancient spear bearing a simple but effective enchantment, providing a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

A demon hit by the spear must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or be paralyzed until the spear is removed from the demon's body.

The Mithral Flank is a name used occasionally in song and poetry to refer to the elven army during the War for Morning. The army's infantry, outfitted in mithral chain and plate, played an important role as a screen on the left flank of the dwarven vanguard during the final action of the war.
