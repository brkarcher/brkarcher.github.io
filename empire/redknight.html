	<body><h2>Red Knight</h2>

<p>A mute Red Knight who bled smoke instead of blood, found standing over a corpse in the Dibang Valley. Slain by the party and dropped the Starstone.</p>

<p>His armor was ancient, and the banners flown from his spears seemed to resemble those of the Immortal Legion.</p>

<p>The party would later learn that this was what remained of the mad mind and immortal body of Guan Jinping.</p>
