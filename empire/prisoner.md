## The Prisoner of the Stone

The basilisk of Urrenhada's Treachery seems to have claimed a few victims, but one of them remained uneaten. The party slew the basilisk, harvested its gut, and hauled her statue out of the mountainhome in hopes of restoring her to flesh and blood.

* Who was she?  
* Where might the party find someone capable of making use of the basilisk's gullet?
