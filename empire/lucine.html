	<body><h2>Steward Lucine</h2>

<p>The Steward is a once-living soul like any other, but she is the rare soul whose understanding of death was so thorough and deep that in the afterlife she has manifested as a robe-wearing skeleton. She is straightforward and somewhat glum in manner, but loyal and witty. In life, she was Lucine, a priestess of Ae, a healer and a chaplain, in Bryniach, one of the kingdoms of the south.</p>

<p>As the Steward of Sanctuary, she minds the settlement and its inhabitants, as she has been doing (alone) since being called here a few centuries ago. She is capable of communicating with Ashkahala, First of the Dead, by means of magical ritual.</p>
