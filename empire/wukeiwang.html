	<body><h2>Wukeiwang</h2>

<p>A small, very old imperial village nestled in a valley deep in the Ki-Rin Range. Inhabited by roughly 50 imperial citizens, human and dwarf, and often plays host to dwarves and halflings interested in exploring the ancient mountainhomes of the northern Ki-Rin.</p>

<p>Dibang valley is home to other people, too, notably the Iorvethen, an elven people whose exact home has not been noted on any imperial charts. They refuse imperial authority, which causes perennial headaches for the Magistrate of Wukeiwang, LÃ³nghua, who has neither the resources nor the inclination to subjugate them by force.</p>
