## Statue of a Human Woman

A shockingly lifelike statue found atop one of the stone altars in the chapel of Urrenhada's Treachery. Portrays a human woman wearing sturdy leathers with a knife on her belt, sitting, her head glancing at something over her left shoulder.

The Pyre Team suspects her to be a victim of the basilisk that laired in the mountainhome.
