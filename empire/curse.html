	<body><h2>The Curse of the Dead Dragon</h2>

<p>In an ancient crypt beneath Baishen, the party found an undead dragonborn attempting to turn corpses into more wights, using a strange smoking orb as part of the ritual. They interrupted the ritual, and the resulting release of energy knocked everyone out. The Dragonborn-Wight escaped, and the party found themselves marked by some curse.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the nature of this curse? What other effects might it have, and what caused it?  </li>
<li>Why did Zhao warn the party not to die? What does she know and what might she find out from the Imperial Archives?  </li>
<li>Why can the party now see the dead who roam Materia?  </li>
</ul>
