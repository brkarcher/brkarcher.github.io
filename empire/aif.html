	<body><h2>Aymon, Ilrune, and Fenian</h2>

<p>A trio of elves, soldiers in the War for Morning. All three were killed by a demon, but Ilrune drove it through with an enchanted spear with her dying effort.</p>

<p>As ghosts, they stood watch over the demon trapped by the spear until Danai pulled the spear free and the party slew the revived demon.</p>

<p>Aymon and Ilrune are brother and sister, both free spirits and eager conversationalists. Fenian was an eldritch knight, being the more studious and taciturn of the trio.</p>
