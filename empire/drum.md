## Frost Drum

A heavy bronze kettle found in the ancient mountainhome now known as Urrenhada's Treachery. LÃ³nghua believes it to be original to the mountainhome, which dates it to at least three millennia ago

The kettle has a powerful and permanent enchantment. Anything placed inside the kettle for an hour will become very cool. Anything placed inside the kettle for a day will freeze.

Sold to the town of Wukeiwang for a promissory note of 200 gold, likely to be used to freeze water in order to store meats brought in by trade.
