	<body><h2>Figment</h2>

<p>A sword manifest by The Watcher's dreams, symbolizing his duties and guardianship. It is quite real, but as it has been pressed into existance by the mind of a beholder, it is really best thought as an impression upon the fabric of reality, which can be felt around and filled in, rather than a physical object.</p>

<p>Once per day, a mortal attuned to Figment may will it into a different shape, requiring a Wisdom check whose difficulty is related to how different the new form is from its current form.</p>

<p>If Figment is in the form of a weapon, it is as a +1 Weapon.</p>
