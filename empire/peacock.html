	<body><h2>Symbol of the Peacock</h2>

<p>An embroidered Mandarin Square, once worn by Lóngtó, the One Hundred and Twenty-Second Imperial High Censor. Lóngtó was a gifted diplomat, one of the most accomplished the Empire has ever seen. His greatest achievement was to negotiate the annexation of the Tuyagi Dynasty into the Shining Empire. The only drop of blood spilled was his own: he was murdered by the Tuyagi heir apparent.</p>

<p>The One Hundred and Twenty-Third Imperial High Censor's first act was to award the square worn in Lóngtó's robes to his family. His second act was to apprehend, convict, and execute the Tuyagi heir.</p>

<p>How the square came to be in the Dibang Valley is unclear.</p>

<p>When sewn into any piece of clothing, this square grants the wearer +1 CHA and +1 AC. Be careful not to anger any Mandarin by wearing a symbol of their station.</p>
