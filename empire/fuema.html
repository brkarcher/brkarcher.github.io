	<body><h2>Fuema</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oingo has barely stretched out his neck to lick the gemstone when you see a woman leaning on a tree not twenty feet away. She is tall, made taller by the pair of curling rams horns that crown her head. She is dark, made darker by her inky black hair and eyes. She is strange, made stranger by the arcing anlters and twisting brambles tattooed in ochre up from her ankles and down from her neck. She wears a simple waistcloth and chest binding.</p>

<p>"I would be careful with that."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuema is a tiefling "stargazer" (by her own admission, a euphemism for sorcerer) who lives alone in the Dibang valley. The Pyre Team met her first when she made a sudden appearance after they took down the Red Knight and began to investigate the Starstone he had dropped.</p>

<p>She has offered to help the party investigate the starstone, and a few days later the party returned to accept.</p>
