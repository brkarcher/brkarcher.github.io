[Welcome to the Midnight Oil!](http://zombo.com/)

I'll start from the beginning: D&D means a lot of things to me.  It's the canvas upon which I paint my imagination, it is the mirror by which I may gauge my creative skill, and it is the window through which I may wave at (or yell at, or laugh with) my friends.  The last few months have left me without all that, and it's about time I take it back.

The problem, of course, is the physical distance the separates me from most of the people I would play with.  But thanks to the magic of the internet, that problem can be solved.  This website, themidnightoil.net, will be the virtual room—a little private treehouse—in which I can hang my canvas/mirror/window/overly elaborate metaphor.

The idea is to play D&D *by post*, an art I first discovered by way of my high school group when we played some games on a site called DnDOnlineGames (now known as [RPG Crossing](http://www.rpgcrossing.com/)).  The idea is that you play on an internet forum, where the DM makes the topics and you dictate your character's speech and actions with your replies.  Usually, the forum itself has some facility for "rolling dice" along with your post for the sake of combat.

To give you an example of what this looks like, [here's a thread](http://www.rpgcrossing.com/showthread.php?t=68196&page=11) from the very game we played about four years ago.  Combat starts on the next page.  I feel compelled to warn you that it was a very silly game—my best friend in the party, for example, was a bear who was a ninja and wore formal evening wear—but I make no apologies.  It was radical.

There are several obvious advantages: the game can be played long-distance, and you can hop on to post *whenever you want to*.  In addition, I personally feel able to better characterize my characters given time to sit down and mull over what exactly they would say.  Some of the disadvantages are also pretty obvious: the game moves much more slowly, and there are always a few cases where it's hard to follow the rules properly online (for example, interrupts).  Some players feel constrained when they only have text (and sometimes illustrations) to express their characters.  And sometimes it's just plain hard to make sure people keep paying attention.

I'd like to see if we could overcome those challenges to play a game, by post, here on this site.

(Why this site?  Why not host on RPG Crossing?  Like I said, this is my treehouse.  I get to make the rules.  I can do *whatever I want*, and by extension, you guys  and gals will be able to do pretty much whatever *you* want.  It's also a good way to keep my technology skills sharp.)

I'll be starting a few threads in the forums where we can figure out what the ground rules should be, what kind of game we want to play, and when we can play it.  I'll see you there!
