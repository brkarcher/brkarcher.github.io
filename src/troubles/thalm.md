## Thalm

Local Regalport human thug and associate of the Boromar Clan. As with many successful men and women of his vocation, he has a cold predatory instinct tempered with caution and an eye for self-preservation.

Met the party in the Rainbow Inn and Keep at Topside, then arranged a purchase of the necklace the party stole from Prince Kolberkon estate in Port Verge. He was attended by some muscle, and he was able to detect the deadly trap lying in wait in the necklace. Is he an expert jeweler? A keen trapsmith? A polymath?
