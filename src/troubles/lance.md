## Lance

A late-model war galleon commissioned and built by Breland in the shipyards of Eastcross.

Was a linchpin of the Brelish naval presence in the far east, dispatched for time-sensitive missions that required its speed as well as anti-piracy missions that required its firepower.

Consumed by a fire on 25 Zarantyr, 998 set by the crew of the *Crown* as part of a trap for Thalm and the *Clansman*.
