## Captain Arazka

As described by his former sergeant of marines, Camouflage:

> Captain Arazka is a tall, dark-skinned human man with greying hair, one eyepatch and a golden false eye. He is a temperamental man who will shout and demean his subordinates as it pleases him. This would make him unpopular with his crew, but he selects crewmembers who are pleased by his preferred missions, smuggling and plundering. He seems to be a capable artificer, and he possesses a number of magical devices that enable his piracy.
> 
> He operates out of Port Verge. He employs his ship, the Mercurial, mostly in drug smuggling, particularly Dreamlily.

A member of the XLVII Legion. A cruel and cunning fighter and captain who was not well-loved by his friends or crewmates but was greatly valued as an asset and despised as an enemy.

On 1 Zarantyr 998 he ambushed his comrade and fellow Cyran privateer Captain Tyrn and ordered the capture of the *Crown of Mishann*. This led to a spiraling chain of events that culminated in his death on Ostarlan on the 24th of that very month.
