## Crown of Mishann

The *Crown of Mishann* is a late-model war galleon commissioned and built by Breland in the shipyards of Eastcross, making her maiden voyage in the spring of 987. A long, sleek two-decker loaded to the gills with armament, she was originally named the *Javelin* and likely intended to serve as a cruiser or a harrier in the desperate last years of the war, where a supply caravan capture could be crucial to the maneuvering armies in southern Khorvaire.

Loghan Tyrn, however, captured the *Javelin* at port in a daring night-time raid in 988 YK, renamed it, and sailed it to Seaside under a Cyran flag. The admiralty board there was equal parts shocked and impressed by the young man's audacity, and they awarded him with a letter of marque that remained in force until the Day of Mourning.

The *Crown* continues to sail under a Cyran flag, all these years later, but it seems unlikely that any party would extend her crew the legal protections afforded to privateers. Tyrn and his crew are, to the rest of the world, pirates.

At the turn of 998 YK, Captain Tyrn disappeared, last seen by one of the *Crown*'s sailors rowing the longboat out to a meeting aboard the Mercurial, and shortly thereafter the *Crown* repelled a boarding attempt made by a party from the same ship. Seabern Thorpe has stepped up to captain the *Crown* while she attempts to unravel the mystery behind Tyrn's disappearance.
