## Clansman

A Boromar Clan cutter. A ship this size is ideal for operating in defiance of law enforcement; it is relatively fast for a shallow-water ship but also capable of retreating into the open sea, it's low-profile and requires a small crew, and with a little extra manpower it can even be hidden on land.

This one was sunk by the *Crown of Mishann* on 25 Zarantyr, 998.
