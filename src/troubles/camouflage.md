## Camouflage

Camouflage is, like all warforged, a relic of the war. He was a Karrnathi soldier stationed at Karrlakton when the Mourning descended on Cyre. Freed by the Treaty of Thronehold, he immediately contracted himself as a deckhand and has passed from ship to ship until the last ship he was on, a Karrnathi merchant, was captured by the *Mercurial* and he was pressed into service. Captain Arazka immediately saw his potential as a marine, and before long he was Arazka's sergeant of marines.

At Arazka's orders, he boarded the *Crown of Mishann*, but his boarding party was quickly overwhelmed by the superior skill and force of the *Crown*'s crew while the *Mercurial* beat a hasty retreat. When he unexpectedly awakened from his death-like blackout, Fox threatened to kill him, but the rest of the crew urged her to spare him. He has since been pressed into service on the *Crown*â€”something he seems to have accepted with unusual serenity.

Camouflage exhibits a great deal of forthrightness, a keen sense for practical calculation and situational awareness, and incredible physical strength, making him quite the ideal junior officer. He doesn't seem to have developed many technical skills, however, and coupled with the weight he puts on lines and spars, this makes him a poor sailor.
