> An hour later, you are beginning to take in sails and find an anchorage near the island. The island is about a mile lengthways and twice as long as it is wide, consisting of a series of rocks thrust out of the water, one somewhat taller than the others, roughly twice as high as your crow's nest. The gaps are filled with a lush jungle and the entire jumble of trees and rock is encircled by a ring of pleasant island sands.
