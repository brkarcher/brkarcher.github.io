## Aymon, Ilrune, and Fenian

A trio of elves, soldiers in the War for Morning. All three were killed by a demon, but Ilrune drove it through with an enchanted spear with her dying effort.

As ghosts, they stood watch over the demon trapped by the spear until Danai pulled the spear free and the party slew the revived demon.

Aymon and Ilrune are brother and sister, both free spirits and eager conversationalists. Fenian was an eldritch knight, being the more studious and taciturn of the trio.
