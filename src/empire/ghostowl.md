## The Ghost Owl

When the party awoke beneath Baishen, they found themselves accompanied by a talking owl. He introduced himself as Horwendell, and he seems to be a cheeky little fellow who fancies himself a traveler and an eavesdropper.

Once it became clear that nobody else outside the cursed party could see or hear him, Horwendell admitted that he was once human, died, and became a ghost in the form of a talking owl.

Later, he would tell his traveling companions that he was a wizard in life, hoping to find some way to convey a soul from one body to another, on behalf of an unspecified "kid." As he died, he hoped to buy time to finish this work by using what he had learned to manifest as a ghostly owl rather than leaving for the Underworld.

* Why does he accompany the party? Why was he in Baishen in the first place?  
* Who was he trying to help? Is he telling the whole truth?
