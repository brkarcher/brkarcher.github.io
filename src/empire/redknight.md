## Red Knight

A mute Red Knight who bled smoke instead of blood, found standing over a corpse in the Dibang Valley. Slain by the party and dropped the Starstone.

His armor was ancient, and the banners flown from his spears seemed to resemble those of the Immortal Legion.

The party would later learn that this was what remained of the mad mind and immortal body of Guan Jinping.
