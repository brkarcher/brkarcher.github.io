## Guan Jinping

Guan Jinping was one of the Immortal Legion's first seven captains, a peerless swordsman and mighty spirit. He's also quite the capable armorsmith. He's rowdy, gregarious, and dangerous to his foes... and to his friends, should they drink with him. He describes himself jokingly as the "Emperor's favorite" among the captains, though Jin-Mao Huang chose his colleague, Li Su, to be the legion's ultimate commander.

First met the party as the Red Knight in the Dibang Valley.
