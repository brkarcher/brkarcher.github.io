## Starstone

> A purple cut gemstone lies in the grass. It seems to flash and shine, just like if you were holding a polished dagger and twisting it back and forth in the sunlight. Yet the gemstone is sitting still.

Described by Fuema as a "starstone," a fallen star that contains some sort of power. She indicated that it corresponds to the star Xi-Kan, a star associated with seeking, transition, and transcendence.

On a night clear enough for the star Xi-kan to be seen, a spellcaster attuned to the Starstone can cast Teleportation Circle with a destination of Sanctuary.
