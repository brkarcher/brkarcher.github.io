Ellie was sitting at a table trying to keep from being sick for the third time this morning. She had made good use of Tynfi&apos;s bucket on multiple occasions and she was sure this morning wouldn&apos;t be the last. She laid her head down on the table and pushed away some of the food Quel had brought her. His attentiveness was surprising but not unwelcome. She wasn&apos;t sure she would have been able to get food for herself anyway.<br><br>The ship rocks back and forth as Ellie holds her head. Maybe her sister would come by soon. She found Ielenia&apos;s presence comforting especially when she wasn&apos;t feeling well. Which had been a lot recently. How much longer would this last? She was not sure that she could make this entire journey. 

-Nicole, April 11

Clutching the railing, Ielenia felt less and less like vomiting the more she focused her attention inward. <em>Baby steps. </em>She coached herself. Finding Ellie, she quickly opened the nearest porthole, gasping desperately at the air. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I was not here for sooner sister,&quot; she apologized, &quot;the belly of this ship makes mine own feel unsettled. This cramped place is too stark and stale for my tastes.&quot; Turning around to acknowledge the rest of her friends, she switched her attentions back to Ellie. &quot;Would you like to join me on deck?&quot; she asked. &quot;I made friends with the sailor in the crow&apos;s nest.&quot;<br>

<div>Tynfi is to be found at the same table in the same darkened corner of the mess, clutching at a wooden cup... water, of course.</div><div>&quot;Our dear Princess, mingling with the smallfolk? Deigning to notice the sailors oh so far beneath her station? How scandalous.&quot;</div><div>She glances over to Ellie.</div><div>&quot;You should probably go. A little bit of sunlight would do you good.&quot;</div>

&quot;Sunlight, bright, flight, fly away...<em>&quot;</em> Ellie tried to raise her hand to make it sail like a bird but the energy needed was too much. It fell flat against the table and she left it there. She knew they were trying to help but she did not want to go above on the deck of the ship. Not that down here was much better but at least she didn&apos;t have to look at the expansive ocean. With absolutely no land in sight. Her stomach lurched at the thought. She lifted her head with an immense amount of effort and looked at Tynfi and then to her sister.<br><br>&quot;Ok...&quot; she said in a very small voice. Ellie dropped a hand to her belt and fiddled with a pouch until she produced a small pinch of herbs. She was fairly certain she had already expelled the morning dose and didn&apos;t feel like thinking about the vastness of the water. <br><br>She had had every intention of not having to use the herbs everyday but, when she had tried to forgo them a few days ago, she had wound up paralyzed in a corner of the ship. Images of giant waves and bronze scales danced across her memory and the thought that one of those creatures would rise from the depths of the ocean to sink the ship was more than she could handle. Someone had brought her back to the hammocks, laid her down and, when she woke up, an ale was waiting for her. In her delirium, she had no recollection of who it had been but she thanked them profusely as she took her herbs that evening. She was certainly not doing that again. After swallowing her dosage with a drink, she reluctantly rose from the table. <br><br>Ellie reached down to pick up the bucket and bring it with her, &quot;and I&apos;ll clean this out... again.&quot; <br><br>She stood very close to her sister as they walked toward the door that would lead them to the brilliantly lit deck above.<br>

Roan lay silently on his bunk, listening to the waves crash against the hull and hanging on to any conversation the group had. While he had not found the courage to attempt to speak with them since first sailing, he still hung onto every word he heard them speak. He spent his time hacking away at invisible enemies above decks by day, and listening to the stories the others told each other to keep busy at night. He knew he would eventually have to speak out, yet dreaded how poorly the conversation might go. But by this point he was exhausted from training, and he decided such a mental drain couldn&apos;t do any more damage. Once he heard Ellie and Ielenia leaving, he decided to approach Tynfi. While under other circumstances Roan might have thought to approach Ellie first, the influence of the herbs she used worried him as he was never sure what might come out of her mouth. Standing next to the table, Roan gets Tynfi&apos;s attention and asks, &quot;Sit?&quot;

-Carolyn M., April 12

---

Tynfi&apos;s eyebrows rise a little bit.<br><br>&quot;I&apos;m... oh, wait, I see.  Sure, have a seat.  I don&apos;t think you&apos;re much the type for brooding in the darkness, but you&apos;re welcome to try your hand at it.&quot;

-Ben, April 13

---

Roan sits down gently, looking genuinely uncomfortable. He struggles to find the correct words again, &quot;How is your trip?&quot;<br><br>At least this time he said what he meant, however impersonal it was. He had figured out that if he only concentrated on speaking he could talk normally. But pushing other thoughts aside was not an easy feat. Initially this had only been accomplished after harming himself with his ricocheting sword after a misplaced attack, and reacting to the pain by screaming obscenely. The crew who had heard him seemed to respect him more after that outburst.

-Carolyn M., April 14

---

Tynfi leans back, forcing herself to let go of the cup of water.<br><br>&quot;Improving ... slowly... I think.  I&apos;ve finally been able to sleep these past few nights.  I&apos;ve been able to keep more of my food down.  And my hands have stopped... you know.  On the other hand, Ellie is never apart from her ale, and the crew always smells of watered-down liquor; it&apos;s like they <em>sweat</em> the stuff.  I can <em>feel... </em>aw, Hell.  I want a drink so, <em>so</em> badly.  All my life, the world has taught me that I&apos;m the only one who can get me what I want.  And now I can&apos;t even do that.&quot;<br><br>She sighs and forces herself to smile a little.<br><br>&quot;Bah.  That&apos;s what you get for asking how my trip is; you get to share in my miseries.  You know, there was a time I would&apos;ve answered that question with a bald lie or at least a cute quip.  Not any more.  It&apos;s just... I feel like I <em>owe</em> you a real answer.<br><br>&quot;So... how about yours?  You can... take your time.  I haven&apos;t got anywhere to be.&quot;<br>

-Ben, April 14

---

Roan still struggles with his words, but is still greatly relieved that Tynfi did not recoil at his attempts.<br><br>&quot;Talking is still hard. But its getting..... easier. The crew likes me more after my outburst..... yesterday? It is still best to keep training. Train until I sleep. At least.... what little sleep I can. Sleeping is not fun. My dreams... trouble me. But not as much as seeing you, Ielenia, and Ellie in.... pain.&quot;<br><br>He lets out a sigh of exhaustion after talking for so long, and looks down at his hands while patiently waiting.

-Carolyn M., April 14

---

&quot;Hah!  You know how I know you&apos;re still Roan, even after you died?  You&apos;ve been through the worst a mortal soul can experience, you&apos;re <em>still feeling the effects</em>, and yet you&apos;re <em>still</em> worried about the damsels in distress!  One of whom surely deserves every last bit of that distress, one of whom will be feeling much better on dry land in a few weeks, and the last of whom... well, sometimes I wonder if Her Royal Highness might be beyond help.<br><br>&quot;Anyway, kid, you need to look after yourself, and... nightmares?  That sounds serious.  What&apos;s going on?&quot;<br>

-Ben, April 14

---

&quot;I think they&apos;re memories. That was how I remembered you and the others. But they don&apos;t always make sense. And aren&apos;t.... in order. Some are from my real life, and those are good. But even those don&apos;t always make sense.<br><br>&quot;What are you drinking?&quot;

-Carolyn M., April 14

---

&quot;... Water.  Kid... I... where do I start... do you remember anything from the night you died?&quot;

-Ben, April 15

---

&quot;I remember all of it. At least, I think I do.&quot;

-Carolyn M., April 15

---

&quot;Hence... the water.<br><br>&quot;...Roan, I&apos;m so sorry.  You, of all people, didn&apos;t deserve that.  You didn&apos;t deserve to be the lone point man on that job, and you didn&apos;t deserve for your backup to show up three sheets to the wind like I did, and you didn&apos;t deserve what ultimately happened.  And with the Gods as my witnesses, if you try to tell me that you <em>did</em> deserve it or that it was somehow excusable, I will <em>hurt</em> you.&quot;<br><br><em>Sigh.<br><br></em>&quot;It occurs to me that... that may not have been why you were asking what I was drinking.  I can be a terrible conversationalist sometimes.&quot;

-Ben, April 15

---

&quot;I partially was. But I will say that I still could have done better to protect you all as well. While I might not mind dying for other people... people I care about... I would not have been happy to be brought back and... if anything happened to the rest of you... I drug you all into that trouble, so I should be able to protect you from it. So that&apos;s why I&apos;ve been practicing. To get better, and not fail again.<br><br>&quot;But I suppose your aim could have been better. And I should eat and drink something.&quot;

-Carolyn M., April 15

---

Tynfi shakes her head, wearing a wry smile.<br><br>&quot;Oh, what the Hell.  Fine, believe you weren&apos;t good enough, if that&apos;s what you like.  I&apos;ll just go on believing that you&apos;re insane.<br><br>&quot;As for food, I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help there.  The cook doesn&apos;t like me.  <em>Really</em> doesn&apos;t like me.  You know, muttering prayers under his breath until I leave his sight, that kind of thing.  It&apos;s like this crew <em>doesn&apos;t even know </em>that my presence wards off angry dragons!  Anyway, you&apos;re better off getting the food from him yourself or having Quel get it for you.  But hey, kid, if you&apos;re going to go... I can tell this isn&apos;t easy for you.  If you ever need to practice your words in front of someone who has done her share of talking backwards... it&apos;s the <em>least</em> I can do, no?&quot;

-Ben, April 15

---

&quot;I would like that.&quot; Roan beams as he stands up to find Quel, and hopefully some food. He also couldn&apos;t help but to think to himself about why he had associated Tynfi with the nickname &apos;Sunshine&apos;. He was definitely starting to remember that.

-Carolyn M., April 16

---

Quel is no where to be found. It isn&apos;t that he&apos;s hiding per se, all you&apos;d really need to do is follow the music to his resting place, but it appears that the majority of his companions dislike water, sunshine, boats, or himself, or maybe a combination of all of those things. For the past few days he&apos;s been relatively unmolested by anyone but the odd sailor passing by. He is in his favorite spot on all ships; Reclining lazily on the prow with his hands behind his head soaking up the sun. The weather is simply too perfect to be inside and while you&apos;re sailing you&apos;ve got to take every opportunity to get some fresh air. He knows this from experience.<br><br>He breathes in the salty sea foam from waves breaking against the hull and gazes up at the clear blue sky. Shirtless, with his leathers rolled up past his knees, and without shoes, he could almost pass for one of the crew. After the better part of a week in the burning sun his mother&apos;s dark hued complexion has come to the fore. His skin is now a deep deep bronze which contrasts starkly with his fiercely golden dreadlocks. The dreads are still clean and tightly wound (a particular neurosis of his) but they appear to be lightening a bit from the sun and salt.<br><br>He&apos;s playing his pan flute still, although he&apos;s using mage hand to do it. Using his real hands would create nasty tan lines to be sure. He&apos;s playing nothing in particularly, just bits and pieces of songs, with some riffs and improvisation of his own thrown in for his amusement. It&apos;s been a while since he&apos;s had time to himself to just sit and dink around on this instrument. He&apos;s left his guitars inside for the majority of the trip. Salt, water, sun, and intricate wood don&apos;t tend to be great bedfellows. <em>Neither do I and anyone on this ship for that matter</em>, he ponders ruefully. <em>The only other woman on this thing besides the ones in the party is the one I&apos;m laying on top of. She&apos;s got the biggest rack of all of them all to be sure but she&apos;s also a wooden carving.</em> He stifles a shiver after a passing thought of receiving splinters in unmentionable places. Returning to his flute, he ponders Heliopis and the rumors he&apos;s heard, and swings a leg absentmindedly from the prow in time with his playing. <br>

-Keith U., April 16

Cocking her head in amusement, Ielenia sneers playfully at Tynfi and quips, &quot;I think you&apos;ve misunderstood something crucial sweetheart. If I deigned to reside in the company of those below my station, I would stay down here with you. Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;we&apos;ve got a pretty good gambling circuit in the evenings. Who knew cards could be so fun!&quot; Winking, she takes one last gulp of fresh air and hurries over to Ellie, taking her gently by the arm. &quot;Come sweet sister,&quot; she cooed, &quot;some fresh air really will do you some good. Let&apos;s get you out of this mess before you fall ill. Or before I become seasick.&quot; The pair cautiously ascend the stairs and make their way to the upper deck.

-Rachel M., April 16

With most of her companions abovedeck (and Illyrio elsewhere or being oddly quiet), Tynfi finds herself alone with her thoughts for the first time in a <em>long</em> time.  Since before arriving in Pwll Glo, probably.<br><br>After some time of simply allowing herself to experience the sensation and ruminate, she glances left and right to make sure nobody is watching.  She puts her feet up on the table and retrieves a tiny scrap of gray fleece from her pouch, running it between her fingers, drawing patterns with it in the air, and focusing on an empty spot on the table.  A dagger, its blade shimmering like a dancing flame, appears there.  Frowning, Tynfi makes it vanish with a wave of her wrist, and repeats the process.  This time, the grip has a red, stony texture, but at least the edge looks believably metallic.<br><br>She repeats this process again and again, alternating between daggers, playing cards, glass mugs, and gold coins.  After the first few, she begins to hum to herself an old tune...<br><br><em>I&apos;ve got a sword at my side but that sword won&apos;t cut,<br>My fingers on the pommel but the scabbard seems stuck.<br>I can&apos;t stop staring at the setting sun,<br>Even if I could I would never give up...</em>

-Ben, April 17 (edited: April 17)

(Out of Character: <em>With a fire in my heart and a dagger in my lungs, I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ll die with this song unsung</em>)<br><br>As the sun set, Ielenia returned below decks with Ellie, an uncharacteristic aura of peace radiating from her. &quot;I&apos;ve started a gambling circuit with the sailors. However some players seem to have been neglecting their duties,&quot; she said, staring pointedly at her companions.<br>

-Rachel M., April 18 (edited: April 18)

---

As they returned to under the ship, Ellie left Ielenia for a moment to grab some ale, dancing across the belly of the ship. <br><br><em>I haven&apos;t been getting them food. I miss hunting, stalking, tracking, cracking, stacking... maybe they would like drinks instead. </em><br><br>She danced back to the table holding mostly full cups, her gracefulness having saved most of the liquid from splashing out. After handing a full ale to Ielenia and placing a few others on the table, she placed one full of water directly in front of Tynfi. At least she had been observant enough to notice that.<br><br><em>Perhaps the water tastes like whiskey.</em> <em>I shall have to ask. I miss drinking with her and she told me to come here anyway. Come to the ship, what can we do?... You&apos;ll be fine, we&apos;ll sail with you... Ships and sails, stories and tales, drinking ale...</em><br><br>She reached into another pouch on her belt and pulled out a small pearl. She tossed and caught the pearl a few times in her hand, tossing in rhythm to her song. Her gaze continued going from her hand to the air. <br><br>&quot;Gambling?&quot;, she asked, her eyes shining.<br>

-Nicole, April 18

---

Tynfi snaps out of her contemplations at their approach, having long ago exhausted her patience for rehearsal.<br><br>&quot;Whoa.  Thank you, Ellie.  Princess, <em>Neglecting</em>...?  Well, <em>I never!</em>  I take my duties as a gambler and ne&apos;er-do-well very seriously, I&apos;ll have you know.  Where and when?&quot;

-Ben, April 18

---

&quot;Once the sailors have finished their duties for the night we&apos;ve made a habit of meeting up by that steering wheel. Perhaps Quel will join us tonight. I know he&apos;s seen us.&quot; Laughing to herself, she continued, &quot;He&apos;s made quite the place for himself as the ship&apos;s figurehead.&quot;<br>

-Rachel M., April 18

---

Tynfi snorts back a laugh.<br><br>&quot;Of course you would play right on the damn quarterdeck!  Of course you would.  Let&apos;s just make sure the man on watch stays happy.  If he blabs to the captain... well... some captains are very protective of their quarterdecks.  To say nothing of the ones who frown on their crew having any fun.&quot;<br>

-Ben, April 19

---

Quel enters the mess from the decks above with heads and arms still inside his shirt. He casually puts the garment on fully and saunters over to the table where he acknowledges the party warmly. Afterwards, he grabs the ale clearly meant for him and drains the mug dry. <br><br>Spinning deftly on his heel, and taking his mug with him, he leaves the mess without another word to the group. <br><br>On deck again he greats his friend the cook warmly. The cook is apparently very fond of early last century elvish pan flute music (who knew?!?) and has taken rather a liking to Quel. &quot;Evening Emerell,&quot; Quel quips good naturedly, &quot;what delicacies do you have for us today? I hope it&apos;s better than that goulash from a couple nights ago, I damn near cracked a tooth on something in that stuff!&quot; He grins boyishly and roars with laughter with the cook and the few pockets of crewman nearby.<br><br>Some time later, a smiling Quel re-enters the mess laden with food and with a full pitcher of ale balanced on his head. He joins the party at the small table in the corner. He grins while he doles out warm rolls, grilled fresh fish, and cheese to the group and re-fills all the mugs.<br><br>Sitting down, he eyes Illenia closely and begins. &quot;So, princess, I hear the crew has taken quite a liking to your little gambling racket.&quot; He pauses to sip some ale and continues with a genuine smile. &quot;I&apos;ve been chatting with the cook and some of the crew just now and it appears they&apos;re all very...&quot; he stops, trying to think of the most appropriate word, &quot;<em>fond </em>of you. Do be careful, please. It&apos;s been my experience in my travels that sometimes gamblers are playing a long con.&quot; His eyes, still generally fixed on Illenia, go out of focus as if remembering something from long ago and his voice softens slightly. &quot;You might win early and often when the stakes are low but somehow, when it comes down to that final hand and you&apos;re in way over your head, they always manage to win big.&quot; He shakes his head to clear his mind and finishes his ale. Pouring himself another mug he finishes, &quot;With that in mind, please don&apos;t wager your soul or your firstborn child. There are very few games indeed that cannot be rigged.&quot;<br><br>He leans laconically away from the table and balances his chair on two legs, &quot;Now, on a less serious note, how was everyone&apos;s day?&quot;<br>

-Keith U., April 19 (edited: April 19)

---

Ielenia nods thoughtfully, and pours herself some ale. &quot;They&apos;ll like me plenty until they learn I&apos;ve been using them to practice pick-pocketing.&quot; Eyes glittering and obviously very proud of herself, she tears apart a roll and promptly stuffs half of it into her mouth. Addressing the more pious members of the group she mumbled through the bread, &quot;I always put the stuff <em>back.&quot; </em>Gesturing to Ellie with her ale, Ielenia continues, &quot;We&apos;ve had a great day.&quot; Clinking glasses with her sister, Ielenia quickly downs half of the glass and reaches for a helping of fish. Rather bluntly, Ielenia says, &quot;I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re speaking from personal experience about the gambling, Quel? I can imagine plenty of that happened while you were... touring the bars? Is that what it&apos;s called?&quot;<br>

-Rachel M., April 19 (edited: April 19)

---

Ellie wasn&apos;t sure if she was excited or overwhelmed between the introduction of food, talk of gambling and stealing, Ielenia&apos;s hair swishing back and forth, Tynfi&apos;s tail, which she remembered as being very fun, overflowing glasses full of ale and Quel balancing on the chair. She put the pearl back in her pocket and darted her eyes around the table.<br><br><em>There is so much going on right now!</em><br><br>She decided to sit next to Tynfi, in case her tail started moving again, and her sister, because she made her happy, and just watch everything. She start stuffing her face, grinning happily as she ate a large plate of fish and cheese.

-Nicole, April 19

---

Quel returns his chair to four legs slowly. He clinches his teeth and rubs his jaw thoughtfully for a couple of minutes. <br><br>&quot;From personal experience yes, but from &apos;touring the bars&apos; as you so eloquently put it, no. I don&apos;t gamble with anyone but friends anymore. It causes too much trouble and as I said, most games can be rigged given enough people or time.&quot;<br><br>He pours himself some more ale and returns to his lounging.

-Keith U., April 19 (edited: April 19)

---

A devilish grin slowly spreads across Ielenia&apos;s face as she leans forward on her elbows to get a little closer to Quel. Lowering her voice, she asked, &quot;Are you hinting that we should be rigging these games?&quot;

-Rachel M., April 19

---

&quot;No. I&apos;m not.&quot; he says curtly. &quot;I&apos;m saying in no uncertain terms that you should be careful when gambling with people you don&apos;t know, which includes these sailors. Gambling is fun until you lose something worth keeping. My advice would be to entertain yourself by doing something constructive but since 2 of my 5 favorite pass times are virtually unavailable on this little journey, unless Ellie decides to share her wealth, don&apos;t ask me what to do.&quot;

-Keith U., April 19

---

Tynfi eats greedily, as usual.<br><br>&quot;Don&apos;t get sloppy if you&apos;re going to cheat sailors.  If they catch you they&apos;ll want to fight.  Not that you can&apos;t handle yourself in a fight, but... one learns that some fights are destined to end poorly, even for the... victor.<br><br>&quot;Say, Quel, it sounds to me like you&apos;ve put more than gold on a table before.  Don&apos;t tell me that you go harder than I do at my own favorite vice.&quot;<br>

-Ben, April 19

---

He chuckles ruefully, &quot;I&apos;ll spare us all the obvious witty retort about having sex on tables and skip to answering the spirit of your comments.&quot; He finishes the joke with a jovial laugh and a devilish grin. After taking several sips of ale he continues, &quot;In a prior life yes I played for more than gold. But then again, is it really considered &apos;playing&apos; if you already know the outcome?  It&apos;s no matter now, I&apos;m done with ALL of that and have no desire to go back. Music and all it entails is my life now and I much prefer it that way.&quot;<br>

-Keith U., April 20 (edited: April 20)

---

Tynfi smiles and rolls her eyes the way one might smile and roll their eyes at a so-bad-it&apos;s-good pun.<br><br>&quot;Oh, good. I had almost forgotten that you like fucking. How good of you to remind us. Well, if you&apos;re not going to tell us about this previous life of yours, I&apos;m just going to have to imagine that you wagered your soul against the King of Hell in, oh, a shit-eating-grin contest.&quot;<br><br>She pushes her empty plate forward a bit to make some room. She leans onto the back two legs of her chair, puts her feet up on the table, and takes a nice, deep breath... glancing jealously at the several mugs of ale.<br><br>&quot;You know, that makes for a pretty good mental image. You should make that your story for the next time gambling comes up.&quot;

-Ben, April 20 (edited: April 20)

---

Ellie was apparently so obsessed with eating, she only caught part of the conversation.  She stopped eating just long enough to look from Tynfi to Quel and ask, &quot;You met the King of<em> Hell</em>?&quot;

-Nicole, April 20 (edited: April 20)

---

Quel laughs sardonically. &quot;No, Els, I didn&apos;t. He&apos;s rather a homebody and I&apos;m not planning a visit to his neck of the woods any time soon.&quot; <br><br>He turns his attention to Tynif, &quot;As for the sex part, who doesn&apos;t?!? I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve got another like 2 weeks on this ship with no outlet for all the pent up &apos;energy&apos;! I know exactly what I&apos;m doing the first chance we get on dry land.&quot; He ends wistfully.<br><br>Turning serious, he drops his chair to four legs with aplomb and leans forward, elbows on table, resting his chin in his hands. &quot;So I&apos;ve told you that I&apos;m an orphan. I think most of you figured out my mom was a whore. Well, after she died bringing me into this world, I was truly alone. Since I had nothing, my mother&apos;s friends and co-workers raised me. Some people would call them whores, others would say ladies of the night, I just called them all mom. That part of my adolescence probably has something to do with my peculiarities now but that&apos;s a discussion for another time. The brothel I lived in was a very profitable piece of a large network owned and operated by a <em>very</em> notorious thieves guild. I&apos;m not going to mention names and places. I&apos;m square with those guys and there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going back. Anyway, when I was young, they used me as a confederate, entry man, swindler, confidence man, and runner. I had participated in more cons by the time I was 7 than most of the upper guild members had in their lives. Some of the cons involved fixing gambling events. Whether it was fights, or cards, or dice these guys could find a way to get certainty rather than chance. They were incredibly adept at playing long cons.&quot; He grabs his ale, takes a couple of long drinks and winks at Tynfi as he puts his mostly empty mug down.<br><br>&quot;Now Tynf, you mentioned wagering souls. Truthfully that&apos;s fairly commonplace and frankly it&apos;s a terrifying proposition. Not only is it essentially an instant death sentence but it&apos;s also consigning one of your most important parts to torture. I&apos;ve seen people&apos;s souls conned away just like money, property, children, and the like but, in my estimation, those are all picnics when compared to a con called shell stuff. I never saw one, nor was I a part of the guild when one was attempted, but as it was explained to me, the end game is to cram two souls into one body. The stronger of the two souls, usually the one that was inserted because it had the advantage of surprise, controls the body and the mind, leaving the other soul as an observer to reality without any ability to intervene. From what I&apos;ve been told, the second soul is still conscious of life, has emotions, and is aware of the activity around it but totally incapable of affecting reality.&quot; Quel shudders, &quot;Talk about a nightmare.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That said, princess, I seriously doubt that these sailors are evil enough to steal your soul or your first born child, but it&apos;s better safe than sorry. Gambling, unless it&apos;s with people you know and trust, isn&apos;t a sound decision financially or otherwise.&quot;

-Keith U., April 20

Tynfi looks for a moment like she wants to ask Quel something early on in his story but thinks better of it.  When all is said and done:<br><br>&quot;Really?  No, see, I always heard it like this: Quel was traveling in the deep forest one day when he crossed paths with Asmodeus, King of Hell, who invited him to a drink and a game of cards. He offered a simple ante: a magnificent boon to be provided by one of his Lords of the Pit... against Quel&apos;s soul.  Our hero knew his game, though, and declined the cards, instead opting for a smiling contest.  For, you see, the King of Hell, for all his diabolical might, is a monarch given to austerity and scowls.  His otherworldly grimace was no match for our hero&apos;s cheesy grin, and the rest, they say, is history.<br><br>&quot;But seriously... that&apos;s horrible.  I was surprised at first to hear you admonishing us on the evils of gaming, but... well.  You sure as Hell won&apos;t see me sitting at guild tables either, and it seems like I never even saw the half of it.<br><br>&quot;Still, I can&apos;t say I&apos;m going to play &apos;better safe than sorry&apos; tonight.  I&apos;ve gotta keep myself occupied <em>somehow</em>, dammit.&quot;<br>

-Ben, April 20

Quel flashes a token megawatt Cheshire Cat smile but says nothing.

-Keith U., April 20

Ellie munched happily on fish and cheese stacked between rolls. &quot;Thish ish the besh food evah,&quot; she sighed. She poured more ale for herself, Quel and Ielenia, and hesitated over Tynfi&apos;s cup before remembering the water. She passed her another cup of that instead. <br><br>&quot;Why don&apos;t you play each other in cards?&quot;, she asked of the table. &quot;You know each other. Trust each other is something else but at least if you cheat, you won&apos;t wake up with a slit throat. Or, rather, not wake up with one.&quot; She giggled at her own unintentionally macabre joke as she reached over and snagged two more rolls.

Ielenia, having not knowing much about the business of tearing apart souls, stopped eating during Quel&apos;s story and stared disgustedly at her food on the table, no longer much in the mood for eating. &quot;You know,&quot; Ielenia muttered, sounding a bit queasy, &quot;comparatively, that doesn&apos;t sound like such a bad idea.&quot;<br>

&quot;Well, if you&apos;re good standing up your new friends on the quarterdeck, get your beer off the table and deal out the cards.  We&apos;re more fun down here anyway.  Couple of silvers on the ante, I say&#x2014;juuuust large enough for me to have most of your gold by the end of the night.&quot;<br><br>Tynfi has on a smile of her own.  Not quite as broad as the bard&apos;s, of course.<br>

&quot;Deal me in. I already owe Quel money for that topaz of his, might as well owe you two too. Nothing else to do on this ship.&quot; Ellie reached into her pocket and swallowed her herbs with a large gulp of ale. &quot;But I&apos;m keeping my drink. Especially if you get to keep that fire-water of yours, Tyn.&quot;<br><br>Ellie cleared the table of extra dishes and brought them over to a barrel where she spent a few minutes building a tower of plates and cups. When she returned, she took her seat slowly and leaned her head on Ielenia&apos;s shoulder with a content smile. <br><br>&quot;So, since you all appear to be quite the experienced gamblers and cheats... I probably should have brought my own cards... but, stuffed soul shells aside, what&apos;s the best thing you&apos;ve won?&quot;<br>

&quot;Hm.  One time a guy at the end of his rope asked me to accept his promise to leap overboard as his wager against my single gold coin.  I did.  He lost.  He didn&apos;t follow through, so I found an opportunity to push him over the next day.&quot;<br><br>Dramatic pause.<br><br>&quot;We were at anchor with land on the horizon.  Easy enough to throw him a rope.  As it turns out, though, the master-at-arms still didn&apos;t approve.  Lashes.  <em>Again</em>.  Ah, I don&apos;t miss those days, let me tell you.&quot;

Quel chuckles. &quot;I already told you Els, I never gambled. Everything we won was in a tightly controlled environment. There was money, horses, estates, ect. Nothing really exotic to report I&apos;m sorry to say. Thieves love money. I&apos;m done with that now though. I don&apos;t want to be rude but it&apos;s not exactly something I&apos;m super proud of, can we leave it at that?&quot;

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; ; color: rgb( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ; vertical-align: baseline ; white-space: pre-wrap ; background-color: transparent">&quot;Never tell, Quel bell?&#x201D; Ellie replied with her usual singsong, &#x201C;Of course we can leave it at that... I was just... curious.&quot; She lifted her head and asked, &quot;Can you play me a song? I&#x2019;ll pay you for that instead. Do you remember the one you played... the first night in front of the wizard tower? In camp? I like that one... can you play that one? It was pretty...&quot; <br><br>Ellie trailed off as she slowly turned her head toward the table and her cup. She took a very deliberate swallow of ale, enjoying the sensation. The drink tickled and she let out a light laugh. After a pause, she leaned heavily on her hand and studied Tynfi. She found the mental image of her shoving a sailor over the edge of the ship hilarious and smiled warmly at the tiefling as she told her so.<br><br>&quot;But the lashes&#x2026;&#x201D; Ellie winced at imagined pain. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a glutton for punishment it seems&#x2026; I&#x2019;m surprised you don&#x2019;t want to be off this ship as much as I do with all those fond memories. Ah, to be off the ship...&#x201D; She paused thoughtfully, &#x201C;Can you swim? What if it put out your spells...&quot; She shrugged as she returned to dreams of dry land. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait until we dock in Heliopis. I don&#x2019;t care what it looks like&#x2026; How far inland do we have to travel? Nevermind, it doesn&#x2019;t matter... as long as it is off the ship and out of the ocean, it would be better than here.&#x201D; She sighed as she drained the rest of her ale. <br><br>&#x201C;Only&#x2026; sixteen... more days to go.&#x201D; She laid her head back on her sister&#x2019;s shoulder, thoughts of hunting and forests running through her mind, and waited for Quel to decide whether he would play a song for her.</span><br>

&quot;Of course I remember it, it&apos;s one of mine.&quot; Quel says with a genuine smile. &quot;My guitar&apos;s stowed though and frankly I&apos;m too lazy to get it at the moment. I&apos;ll play it for you on flute instead, it&apos;ll sound a bit different but I think you&apos;ll still enjoy it.&quot; <br><br>**Rolled a 25 for performance, which I&apos;m assuming is pretty good**<br><br>After a weeks worth of practicing pretty much non-stop out of sheer embarrassment from his previous poor performance on the flute, Quel&apos;s confidence on the instrument has returned. He plays a beautiful melody on the flute while humming the counter melody. He interlaces the two sounds beautifully. After a few minutes, and a couple of other songs, a few of the sailors, including the cook, drop by to try to figure out where the amazing music is coming from. Finally in his element, Quel continues to play for the ever growing crowd all while weaving his emotions into his music. He plays up-tempo ballads and slow melodies, sings of days gone by, and entertains his comrades and the crew with a few jokes between songs. His performance makes them forget their troubles and work for a time as they all focus on the consuming beauty of his music. After about an hour, as he brings his impromptu performance to close, he plays a couple of renditions of sea lullabies leaving the group in a tranquil state and ready for bed. He finishes to a mild reception, his doing really given his choice to dull the mood in the room in his finale, and takes his seat beside Ellie once again.<br><br>&quot;That ones on the house.&quot; He reclines in his chair again, this time with a content smile on his face. Comfortable, he pulls out his pipe, lights it up carefully with his Cantrip, and basks in the afterglow. <em>Performing is so much better than getting laid...</em><br>

Ielenia welcomed Ellie&apos;s closeness, and she contentedly sat with her sister through Quel&apos;s performance. Closing her eyes, Ielenia allowed the rest of her senses to take over as a warmth and comfort long forgotten seemed to find its way back to her heart. <em>Hello old friend, </em>she thought to herself. <em>It&apos;s been some time since I&apos;ve heard from you.</em> Amidst the gentle rocking of the boat and the salty air, Ielenia couldn&apos;t help her mind from wandering away from the sweet music drifting lazily towards her ears to images of the forests she grew up in. Of laughter and sunlight dappled on leaves, of slow moving streams and the coo of songbirds. <em>Home, </em>she thought placidly. However this time when she was thinking back on her home she wasn&apos;t burdened by the weight of loss. She thought of running through the woods with Ellie, about drinking herself silly with Tynfi and Quel, Roan crashing through the underbrush with all the grace and light-footedness of a raging owl bear.<br><br>As Quel wrapped up his performance, Ielenia slowly opened her eyes, giving herself time to readjust to her surroundings. &quot;You know,&quot; she sighed peacefully, taking care not to disturb Ellie, &quot;I think I&apos;ve taken quite a liking to you guys. You&apos;re not all half bad.&quot;<br>
