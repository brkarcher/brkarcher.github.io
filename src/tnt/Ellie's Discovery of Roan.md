<div>Eiliatae ran lightly
through forest, barely disturbing the leaves carpeting the ground below her.
She was armed with a partly drawn bow that moved with her as if it were an
extension of her own body. She quickly crouched behind a low bush and stared
through the branches at the birds on the ground. They were small but should
bring enough gold to allow her to buy a few more healing potions. She was down
to her last vial after her last scouting trip protecting a small village from
some raiders. They had proved no match for her but some of the villagers had
been injured. She pushed the thoughts away and brought up her bow, pulling it
taught. The soft twang of the bowstring came mere moments before the flock
lifted off the ground, save one grounded bird with an arrow sticking from its
neck. </div>
<div>Ellie stood and loped over the
carcass. She smiled as she pulled the arrow from the bird and returned it to
her quiver. But as she stooped to pick up the bird, she stopped short with her
hand stretched outward. A dull glimmer had caught the late afternoon light. She
cautiously reached toward to the object hidden amongst the autumn leaves and
retrieved a chunk of iron. She stood up, leaving the bird on the forest floor,
and turned the object over in her hands. The chunk was not as nondescript as
she has originally thought- the iron was a carving, once intricate but now well
worn by constant touch. The leather cordage attached to the top was torn, as if
ripped from its original owner. She was immediately wary of the stillness in
the forest and focused her magic to tune into her surroundings. Once she was
satisfied that there was no immediate danger, she turned her attention back to
the symbol. She was unfamiliar with the symbol of the carving but it appeared
to be the sort of talisman used by clerics. </div>
<div><em>&#x201C;But what would a cleric be doing in the woods?&#x201D;, </em>she thought, &#x201C;<em>Where were they now? Had
there been a struggle? Was someone injured&#x2026; or killed?&#x201D;</em></div>
<div>Ellie could find no evidence of
blood but that meant nothing in this world filled with magic. She quickly
gathered the bird, stuffed it in her pack and tied the iron symbol to her belt.
Perhaps someone in town would know what it meant. </div>
<div>She was about to head back to town
when she heard a sound that stopped her. A whimper. She turned her head quickly
back and forth and looked around, drawing her bow in one fluid motion. The
whimpering continued as she searched for the source. Ellie came upon a large,
broken tree, the bark split by a great force, charred and gnarled inward
towards the heart of the tree. There was no life left in the tree, yet the
sound persisted, much louder than before. She leaned her head in the trunk and
started as a tiny face peered back at her. An infant was nestled in a bed of
leaves, wrapped in a piece of hide and cloth. </div>
<div><em>&#x201C;A child in the forest?&quot; </em>Being alive for over 200 years,
it was difficult to surprise Ellie, but this miniature human came close. &quot;<em>What
was it doing here? Who had left it? And why?&#x201D;</em></div>
<div>She reached out and gathered the
human baby close to her; it was bitterly cold and the baby was still whimpering
very softly. She couldn&#x2019;t leave it out here. It was almost winter and the child
was defenseless. She couldn&#x2019;t leave it in the woods unprotected. What about
somewhere in town&#x2026; There was no orphanage but perhaps&#x2026; There was a small monastery
just outside of the town where the Seekers taught their ways. Perhaps the child
would be safe there. They would certainly be able to care for the child better
than she would. Ellie held the infant close in her arms and ran through the
forest towards the monastery. </div>
<div>As she ran in the dwindling light,
thoughts haunted her, &#x201C;<em>Was the abandoned child related to the torn talisman
she had found? Had the child&#x2019;s parents held the talisman as a way to protect
the infant? What had become of them?&#x201D; </em></div>

<div>The moonlight touched the tips of
the tree branches as she exited the forest and she brushed the questions away.
Her main concern had to be the safety of the child at this point. The iron
symbol bounced on her hip as Ellie concentrated on running away from the forest
and towards the security of the lights of Fort Green that had just begun to
burn in the windows.</div>
