Grace stares out the common room window for just a few more minutes, pacing and fidgeting.<br><br>After a few moments of this and being unable to pay attention to the conversation at the table, she tries something. &#xA0;She closes her eyes, traces a figure in the air with her right ring finger, and whispers <em>eo... venio</em>&#xA0;nobody in particular.<br><br>Nox winks into existence in the air before her, gives a pair of confused flaps of her wings, and lands clumsily on Grace&apos;s chest, gripping the mossy-colored cloak at Grace&apos;s left shoulder with her hooked thumbs and looking up cheerfully.<br><br>&quot;<em>Ohmygods</em>. &#xA0;Did you find him? &#xA0;Oh, I don&apos;t care. &#xA0;I can hardly bear to have you that far from me for that long. &#xA0;What is <em>wrong</em>&#xA0;with me? &#xA0;Bah. &#xA0;<em>I don&apos;t care</em>. &#xA0;Mmm.&quot;<br><br>Grace kisses Nox between her ears and returns to the table, hoping none of her friends were paying too much attention.

Ellie stares at Grace, much the same as she has been staring at her all night whenever Nox is present. She seems bewildered by Grace&apos;s loving demeanor towards this tiny animal, especially the tender exchange they have when Nox reappears suddenly in the room. Granted, the bat is fuzzy, adorable, and she is just drawn to its innate cuteness, which Illyrio seems to completely not understand, but... this is <em>Grace</em>.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;I see someone has captured your heart.&quot; Ellie grins at her friend and reaches to scratch between Nox&apos;s ears. The happy little face she receives prompts her to dig through her backpack to find some berries and present them to the winged creature perched on Grace&apos;s shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Granted I thought when the day finally came that I saw you in love, they would be a bit more... humanoid, but I can completely see the attraction.&quot;<br><br>Ellie watches the bat&apos;s big eyes and miniature claws with fascination and then looks to Grace. &quot;So,&quot; she says tenderly, &quot;she was the spell you were working on last night?&quot;

-Nicole, September 28

Nox reorients herself so she can lean out to gleefully accept Ellie&apos;s scratches and berries.<br><br>Grace reddens.<br><br>&quot;Oh, quiet. &#xA0;Yes, the spell I was working on last night was the calling. &#xA0;Takes about an hour to of concentration and ritual preparation to, ah, <em>project my voice</em>, so to speak. &#xA0;Little Nox answered the call. &#xA0;She&apos;s not a bat, really; she&apos;s what the wizards call a Familiar Spirit. &#xA0;She&apos;s... <em>familiar</em>&#xA0;to me. &#xA0;And she took a physical form she thought would be especially familiar.<br><br>&quot;You know the rest. &#xA0;It feels like I&apos;ve known her all my life, but... I&apos;ve never felt so... and on top of that, I can feel every little thing she feels, and... she&apos;s so...&quot;<br><br>Grace trails off, taking a moment to feel Nox&apos;s movement on her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;It still doesn&apos;t all make sense to me, but... anyway. &#xA0;Weren&apos;t we talking about something important?&quot;

-Ben, September 28

---

Ellie continues holding out the berries for Nox but her smile sparkles a little less.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;We were talking about the ridiculous idea you all have to bring a <em>child</em> along with us.&quot;<br><br>She seems frustrated when she turns from Nox&apos;s lovable face to Grace.<br><br>&quot;I don&apos;t know what you are thinking. I am grateful that Abigail saved our lives and she obviously has a talent for hiding if she has been trailing us for however long without any of us being aware of her. But we aren&apos;t talking about bringing her home to a safe and loving family if she comes with us. What happens when we run into something that tries to kill us? Or if we are caught by surprise in an ambush? You can&apos;t hide from everything. Gods, imagine what would have happened to her if she had been in Protsvitaly. We cannot bring her with us.&quot;<br><br>Ellie suddenly becomes very absorbed in playing with Nox and attempts to get her to climb onto her arm.<br>

Oi stares unseeing at Ellie and Grace from a nearby table. He&apos;s incensed and distraught by the senseless waste of life that he and his companions so recently wrought. He&apos;s fighting back being physically sick at the dawning realization that his group isn&apos;t a virtuous as he believed and at the apparent blood-lust shared by Ellie and Grace. His stomach twists and he sets his jaw in a menacing scowl to keep himself from vomiting at the memory of his companions murdering innocents. <em>What kind of monsters slaughter 6 people in cold blood in an unprovoked attack?!? What moral fallacy empowered us to be judge, jury, and executioner?!? <em>We&apos;re not gods or rulers and we have no right to abdicate and subvert the law like vigilantes</em>. Senselessly killing anything is psychopathic and has no place in any society. Even ANIMALS behave with more honor and self control than we just displayed. At least animals only harm others when provoked or for sustenance. Who do we think we are?!?</em> He takes several deep, steadying breaths trying to calm his seething rage and forces his violent emotions to subside. After a moment his stomach stops threatening to expel its contents.<br><br>&quot;Roan,&quot; he rasps quietly to the big man seated next to him, &quot;how could we do that? How could we massacre so many people?&quot;<br><br>He listens to Ellie&apos;s speech about Abigaile, and, sensing an opening, menacingly spits scornfully, &quot;Bah! We can&apos;t bring a child with us, we&apos;re not worthy of that responsibility. We can&apos;t even control ourselves, let alone hope to help teach someone else. At this point I imagine we could learn a thing or two from her.&quot;

Grace seems reflexively uncomfortable with Ellie&apos;s arm hovering nearby, but Nox spreads her wings for a flap and a bounce to land at Ellie&apos;s elbow and begins to clamber up to her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Well, you&apos;re not going to suggest that we just leave her here, are you?  She wants to come with us.  She wants away from these damned people, who drive slaves and worship death and amass their armies for conquest.  <em>I&apos;d</em> rather live a life of travel and peril than meekly accept servitude to the kind of people who run this place... wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;<br><br>Grace&apos;s eyes fall on Oi. &#xA0;She watches intensely.<br><br>&quot;Hm. &#xA0;<em>Not worthy</em>, you say? &#xA0;My, have I heard <em>those&#xA0;</em>words a lot in my life. &#xA0;Might this have to do with the conversation we were having earlier, before we were interrupted by a little scuffle at the back door to that villa?&quot;

-Ben, September 28

---

Oi grits his teeth, and does his best to keep his tone pleasant and chiper as perusual. &#xA0;&quot;It&apos;s deeper than that conversation&quot; he says softly, &quot;but revisting that subject would be a decent starting point.&quot;&#xA0;

-Keith U., September 28

Ellie moves her dark hair to one side to create room for Nox to rest and coos at the little creature as she climbs up her arm.<br><br>&quot;I have spent the last couple of decades ridding the continent of people like the ones you just described; they are horrible people full of hate and rage and mad with power. I understand why she wants to leave but the child will be safer here, where she knows how to survive.&quot; She looks conflicted as she speaks. &quot;Grace, you don&apos;t understand...&quot; <br><br>Ellie&#xA0;shakes her head but it snaps up at Oi&apos;s outburst. Surprise registers on her face.<br><br>&quot;I&apos;m pleased you agree we shouldn&apos;t bring her but I doubt we should be taking lessons of control from an eight-year-old. She didn&apos;t exhibit much of it as she ate the food from Ielenia&apos;s plate. What conversation are you two talking about and, Oi, what do you mean we can&apos;t control ourselves?&quot;

-Nicole, September 28

---

Oi steels himself for his response. &quot;Our conversation was about strategy. I was against entering the house. I was against killing anyone. I was against causing pain and destruction and <em>everything</em> we did. But no one cared. Ursi would&apos;ve listened to me, or at least given my opinion some credence, by none of you all did, not even Roan.&quot; His eyes well slightly with tears, &quot;Ellie, we slaughtered people in that villa without cause. We were a bloodthirsty mob acting without reason or self control. We broke into their home and slew them all without provocation. <em>That</em> is not control but rather wanton arrogance. People in control of themselves don&apos;t slaughter others unless they absolutely necessary and even then they give their opponent an opportunity to surrender before the killing blow is administered.&quot; He sniffles, &quot;We performed an execution in that place and we had no right to do so. Only an egomaniac would have the belief that their arbitrary administration of justice, instead of the application of the law and it&apos;s proper consequences, is a show of control. Surely one as learned and experienced as yourself can see the horror in the crime we just committed. And, surely you can see that we are not a worthy examples to show a child how to behave.&quot;

Ursinalia walks into the common room in a graceful yet intentionally conspicuous way, completely encumbered with flowers from head to toe. She is wearing three delicate wreaths around her head in a silly disarray of white and pink roses that seem to have become a part of her long blonde hair. In her arms there is a huge bouquet of roses and thistles and other wildflowers ranging in every hue imaginable, blues, yellows, pinks, reds, and whites all contrasting with each other to make a huge splash of color. The bouquet is wrapped in a woven mat of green grasses that delicately holds the flowers together while at the same time looks as if it was always meant to grow into a vase. She has garlands of flowers draped around her shoulders like boas that are the same pinks and whites in her head wreaths.&#xA0;<br><br>She bows to an unseen person in thanks for holding the door and hands her a single yellow rose from her cache of flowers, &quot;Thank you young one.&quot;&#xA0;<br><br>As she looks up from the door to see the rest of her group in the inn she says excitedly, &quot;Ah yes you have returned!&quot; She delights over to Ellie placing a kiss on her cheek as she hands her the gigantic bouquet of flowers and then spins her around with her now free hands. She sees what appears to be a bat flutter up off of Ellie&apos;s shoulder. As she spins her she places a wreath upon her head and a garland around her neck making Ellie look almost as if she was a flower, a very dangerous flower. Ursinalia ignores the looks of surprise on her friends faces and alights over to Ielenia who also gets a wreath placed upon her brown and a matching garland. Ursinalia chuckles as the sisters look at each other inspecting their new accouterments. Finally acknowledging her friends questioning looks she begins her tale.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;Well, I left early this morning to see if I could find any more wildflowers for Ellie&apos;s book there, but when I returned you had already left and well since I didn&apos;t know where you had gone and I would much rather not wait around in an Inn I went back out. I feel it was well worth the effort to spend some quality time with the trees and the flowers, I had missed them so. Don&apos;t you agree? Anyways you see I did find you a flower I hope you don&apos;t already have.&quot; Ursinalia reaches into her pouch and pulls out a tiny white blossom, with six perfect long petals, &quot; It is called a Queen&apos;s cup. I was not sure if you would have come across it before. Oh and Oi don&apos;t look so angry! It&apos;s not good for your pretty face.&quot; Ursinalia says scolding Oi as she hands him a bag filled with berries she picked throughout the day.&#xA0;<br><br>Looking at grace Ursinalia realizes that it was indeed a bat that had flown off of Ellie and landed on Grace&apos;s head. She coos softly to the creature and she approaches Grace. &quot;Oh Grace I see you&apos;ve made a new friend, she is beautiful. What is her name?&quot; Ursinalia pulls out a small piece of fruit and offers it to the bat. While she has grace&apos;s attention on the bat she drapes the last garland of pink flowers on Grace&apos;s horns in jest to see what her reaction will be.&#xA0;

Ellie&apos;s sparkling smile returns when she sees a sunshine-filled meadow in the form of Ursinalia glide through the inn, decked in garlands of every color of flower Rumaro has created. She tries to take in all the flowers Ursi hands her but, before she knows it, she&apos;s spinning around and around. Laughter bubbles up as she feels the soft wings of Nox against her cheek and, when she stops spinning, she eagerly accepts the pretty, white flower from her... well, she wasn&apos;t quite sure what to call her relationship with Ursinalia these days. Seeing her friends adorned with pink and white flowers, even a garland draped over Grace&apos;s horns, she can&apos;t help but smile and enjoy the feeling of complete happiness. After a few moments, and a thought or two about whether she could entice Nox back over with some more berries, she sits back down next to Grace and remembers their conversation with Oi.<br><br>&quot;Oi,&quot; Ellie says gently, cradling the lily Ursi has given her, &quot;I do not advocate a child being around that sort of behavior, which is yet another reason I don&apos;t think Abigail should come with us. One of many reasons I have but I never considered one of them to be that we lacked control. In all my years hunting,&#xA0;I&apos;ve never been called bloodthirsty before.&#xA0;You truly believe we were wrong to dispose of everyone in that building? Would you have had me stand by while my sister and friends were attacked?&quot; <br><br>Concern clouded her previously delighted countenance. <br><br>&quot;Before I met everyone here, I was hired to destroy many forms of evil, from bandits&#xA0;to orcs,&quot; she spit on the floor in disgust, &quot;and other creatures that would give you nightmares. You cannot offer creatures such as those a chance at survival through surrender. It would be your own death or the death of your companions to do so. I saw those cultists just as the others. They were solely another type of evil to wipe from this plane and, while I had no qualms about killing them,&#xA0;I did not expect you to be so distressed about that decision.&quot;<br>

Grace leans forward, eyes narrowing.  Then, Ursinalia addresses her, extends a sweet fruit to Nox, and crowns her with a garland.  She leans back and tries to shake it off, but is only successful in making it rest askew.  Meanwhile, Nox has progressed from nosing at the fruit to nibbling through its skin and scooping at the flesh with her tongue.<br><br>Grace sighs; her expression softens.<br><br>&quot;Her name is Nox, courtesy Ielenia.  She&apos;s... yeah... she&apos;s... so <em>sweet</em>.&quot;<br><br>She draws the garland from her head and holds it. She runs her hands over it, speaking deliberately.<br><br>&quot;Oi... Oi. &apos;No one cared?&apos; No one listened?&#xA0;You and I were having just this argument when Ielenia opened the door and accidentally started a fight.<br><br>&quot;Look. This Cult of the Three Deaths has already made an attempt on our lives.  Specifically, Roan&apos;s and my own, for daring to ask questions about them in a Temple of Thania.  This cult is the one that smeared Lester&apos;s entrails across his own home.  This cult attempted to slay Ielenia where she stood for intruding upon their clandestine meeting.<br><br>&quot;We were <em>there</em>.  Their meeting was <em>there</em>.  There is no leaving a moment like that.  I am not going to leave these people to plot and execute their next murder when I can do something about it. The fight, then, was inevitable. These men carry swords, armor, maces, and holy symbols, because they <em>kill</em>&#xA0;to further their cause. Because if anyone stands in their way&#x2014;and I will, because I will not suffer their designs<em>&#x2014;</em>they will fight. So they did. And they fought to their last man. Not one ran; not one even considered a surrender. These are murderous, deluded fanatics who have decided for themselves that they will not cease their fight until death takes them. This wasn&apos;t some senseless, merciless slaughter.&quot;<br>

Oi excitedly accepts the sweet berries from Uris and momentarily forgets his discussion with Ellie and Grace. He&apos;s ripped from his revelry when Grace addresses him and listens, slack jawed at her analysis of the past few days. When she is finished he sighs, &quot;I disagree with your interpretation of many things. True, a segment of this cult did attempt violence on you and Roan. Before fighting them we attempted reason but they attacked us anyway. We defended ourselves and killed many of them. I see nothing wrong with that, although I would have preferred to minimize the death count in the future if possible. However, the actions of that segment cannot be extrapolated to ALL the cultists arbitrarily. Until we are in danger or provoked, we have no reason to kill them. Using the heuristic of  &apos;all death cultists are bad and must be killed&apos; is incredibly similar to &apos;all halflings should be enslaved&apos; or &apos;all orcs will rape you and therefore must not be left alone with women&apos;.  Acting on our prejudice is wrong. Killing before it is necessary is wrong.&quot; He blinks his eyes several times. <br><br>&quot;As for Lester, I don&apos;t believe we have any concrete information about his disappearance and I don&apos;t recall establishing that he is actually in fact dead or even that the cult is definitely involved. To be sure, the halflings have given us some bits of information and we saw a significant amount of blood but a healer of even my moderate skill could have made him whole. I&apos;ve already said the blood in this villa was not from a mortal wound. We haven&apos;t found his body, and, correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but any suspected involvement on the part of the cult comes from third party sources who we can&apos;t verify or implicitly trust. Until we have more proof, we&apos;re acting on suspicion and prejudice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As for the events at the villa,&quot; He clinches his jaw but relaxes his stance to an nonthreatening posture, &quot;Ielenia broke into their house. Not saying that this is true, but it could be interpreted that they were just protecting themselves against thieves when she opened the door. The fact is, at the villa, we sought out and relished in the conflict. Objectively, we were in the wrong and they were defending themselves. If you enter into a bear&apos;s cave it will protect itself and it&apos;s space and lash out at you. We found them out, we broke into their house, we initiated the fight and didn&apos;t even give them a chance at redemption. We didn&apos;t ask if they would surrender; we didn&apos;t even attempt to talk to them. We invaded and systematically wiped them out without mercy. You may rationalize cold blooded murder  any way you desire but from an objective standpoint, we acted monstrously back there. If there is a formal investigation as to what happened we will likely be tried and convicted of many crimes. <br><br>His tone turns sad and somewhat pensive, &quot;Your thought process sounds eerily similar to theirs.  A moment ago, we acted like murderous fanatics who killed those stood in their way. We did so with a biased mind having predisposed belief that they were to be killed on sight for being what they were. A moment ago, they stood in opposition to us and we killed them for it. Think about it, we acted no better than their cult. We only survived to spin the history.&quot; <br><br>He shakes his head, &quot;Furthermore, that encounter was not inevitable. There were authorities and Star who could have been notified; people who could have dealt with the cult in an established fashion. We could have kept watch on the building but instead we succumbed to bloodlust and the belief that our viewpoint was superior to theirs and <em>chose </em>to kill. I&apos;m sure Thrask had a similar superiority complex when he enslaved the halflings. I&apos;m sure Hugo egotistically believed he acted with the best intentions when he bound the dragons. &quot; <br><br>He stares intently at Grace with kindness and remorse filling his features, &quot;We were wrong to do what we did. Listening to you, you probably believe we did a service to society by ridding the world of those men and that we were right to slaughter them. I don&apos;t believe we have the right to make that distinction. There are laws and proper procedure in place to ensure that we fallible and emotional creatures make the best choices. Taking the law into our own hands is inappropriate regardless of the mitigating factors or extenuating circumstances. I believe killing should to be avoided at all costs and life, even an evil one, is to be protected under most circumstances.&quot;<br><br>He smiles weakly, &quot;Doing the right thing is often difficult but that doesn&apos;t mean we should take the path of least resistance to get the result most favorable to us as quickly as possible. If you can&apos;t see the hypocrisy in what we&apos;ve just accomplished maybe our differences run deeper than we can solve but I don&apos;t  believe that. I&apos;ve seen you with Nox and I&apos;ve seen you associate with Ellie and Roan and the others. You have a good heart. The villa was just a terrible situation and it brought out the worst in us.&quot;

&quot;Oi, you cannot compare&#xA0;this cult to the entirety of the halfling people. &#xA0;Or even the orcs. &#xA0;And you cannot compare them to <em>us</em>. &#xA0;We have every reason&#xA0;to believe that their <em>mission as cultists&#xA0;</em>is despicable. &#xA0;Unless you want to argue that, when they tried to murder me, it was a <em>rogue cell</em>&#xA0;whose actions would be roundly condemned by the morally upstanding greater area council of the cult of the three deaths. &#xA0;Unless you think they want to use the Chains for noble purposes. &#xA0;Unless you <em>seriously</em>&#xA0;think it was someone else who did that to Lester for, you know, <em>spying on the cult</em>.<br><br>&quot;The cult, apparently, has a history; a history enough for it to have been quashed by an inquisition once before. &#xA0;If you still need convincing, we could surely locate the litany of their misdeeds. &#xA0;Although, if&#xA0;<em>sent a hit squad to kill me within days of setting foot in the city</em>&#xA0;doesn&apos;t have you convinced, I don&apos;t know what will.<br><br>&quot;You keep using words like <em>systematically</em>&#xA0;and <em>slaughter</em>&#xA0;and <em>cold-blooded</em>&#xA0;and <em>without mercy</em>. &#xA0;Oi, it was a fight<em>.</em>&#xA0; It was hectic. &#xA0;It was confusing. &#xA0;It was fierce. &#xA0;It was the very definition of hot-blooded. &#xA0;If I follow every attack with a, &apos;do you surrender now?&apos; &#xA0;<em>I will run out of breath and die.</em>&#xA0; If they wanted to give it up, there&apos;s an age old tradition of throwing down one&apos;s weapons and showing one&apos;s empty hands. &#xA0;They <em>did not want to surrender</em>. &#xA0;You are blinding yourself to what happened by cloaking the events in words that do not apply to them. &#xA0;And you, intentionally or unintentionally, continually insult me by doing so.<br><br>&quot;I maintain that the fight was inevitable. &#xA0;Had we summoned the town watch, they would have fought the town watch to the death. &#xA0;If we had summoned the inquisition, they would have fought the inquisition to the death. &#xA0;Had they not merely slipped away and murdered someone else, that is. &#xA0;There will be no laws or procedure with them. &#xA0;There will never be; they will never allow it.&quot;<br><br>Grace rubs her forehead, trying to stem her frustration.<br><br>&quot;This would have been a radically different night if even a single one of them wasn&apos;t fully set on this whole <em>death</em>&#xA0;thing. &#xA0;Yeah? &#xA0;I didn&apos;t storm in there to render their souls onto Thania&#x2014;I bet that&apos;s something <em>they&apos;d</em> do, by the way&#x2014;I stormed in there because Ielenia was in a pinch, whether she &apos;started it&apos; by opening that door or not. &#xA0;And more broadly, we were there in the first place because we wanted them <em>stopped</em>&#xA0;and it was going to take a fight to do that, not because we wanted the pleasure of sucking their last breaths from their cold, falling chests. &#xA0;So would you <em>quit </em>calling us bloodthirsty monsters?&quot;<br>

-Ben, September 29

&quot;I can compare them! They are alive and given that gift by the Gardener. <em>All </em>life is important and should be venerated, no matter how small or unpleasant it may be and we do not have the ability to take it away barring extraordinary circumstances. Regarding your next point, I know of another people who were persecuted, hated, and condemned as a group without being judged individually. I would think you out of all of us would have a perspective on how it is to be judged prematurely.&quot; Oi says wryly.<br> <br>&quot;Perhaps I am being unclear or obtuse, so please allow me to clarify.&#xA0;I&apos;m not saying that this cult is good or bad. In fact, I have every belief that they, as a collective, are evil. What I am saying is that it is not our right to kill people unless they&apos;ve attacked <em>us. </em>We are not at war. We are not agents of the monarchs here. We have been given no authority to carry on as we did. Killing a household of people, under most circumstances, is not highly regarded, less so when you <em>break</em>&#xA0;<em>into </em>the house and make no attempts at reason with its occupants. To be blunt,&#xA0;I objected to us going in there. I objected to involving ourselves with that kind of practice BUT when Ielenia was in trouble and when the fighting began I moved to protect myself and my friends just as you did. It is my personal belief that instigating fights, regardless of the opponent, regardless of their established intent, is inappropriate and does not value life. I believe we were in the wrong for breaking into their space and then once we secured Ielenia, for not at least attempting a retreat or negotiations. I agree with you that from prior dealings with this group negotiations may have ended poorly but that does not mean we should summarily foreclose them as a possibility. If we don&apos;t attempt to act human and value the lives of others we are just like this cult and so many other bullies. If we travel down this path, no matter what type of disillusionment we manufacture for ourselves, we&apos;re not protecting the weak or ourselves, we&apos;re being ruthless vigilantes, which under the law of this land, equates us to murderers and thieves.&quot; &#xA0;<br><br>&quot;Furthermore, we&apos;ll never know if a fight could have been prevented. You may believe with everything you are that it was inevitable, you may even be correct in that believe, but we won&apos;t know because we didn&apos;t negotiate and we didn&apos;t wait for reinforcements from the proper authorities. I agree that this encounter is skewed by the fact that we entered the property before a consensus had been made but it&apos;s at least possible they could have surrendered, irrespective of our prior dealings with them. If they hadn&apos;t surrendered to the proper authorities then those people vested with power would have the right to take them by force, if necessary. We do not have that power. We are not watchmen or inquisition, or soldiers or Thrask&apos;s agents. We&apos;re a band of adventures not duly authorized representatives of the authority here in this town.&quot;&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;Lastly, you perceive insult where there is none. If you wish to play the matyr that&apos;s fine but note I have not accused you specifically of anything nor said anything other than an objective analysis of how our actions. I condemn our actions as a group and I would hope to travel with people who believe that breaking into a dwelling and killing the majority of its inhabitants is something regrettable, regardless of the nature of those slain. Causing death should be a last resort and killing without remorse is unnatural, no matter the life that is taken. You do feel regret from killing those men, don&apos;t you?&quot;&#xA0;<br>

-Keith U., September 29

Grace&apos;s frustration slowly bubbles up. &#xA0;She stands, leaning over the table onto her hands. &#xA0;Then, there is a great flapping and squeaking as Nox absconds from Ursi and her fruit and descends onto Grace&apos;s shoulder, passing directly in front of her face with a great commotion and flailing of arms.<br><br>When it&apos;s all over, Grace stands at the table, looking a little bit like a cat that&apos;s been drenched in water while Nox nibbles at her ear.<br><br>&quot;Stupid... ugh. &#xA0;She&apos;s right.&quot;<br><br>She sighs, and continues calmly.<br><br>&quot;Look, before we go on, I want to get something straight. &#xA0;Your &apos;objective analysis&apos; ascribes motivations to me. &#xA0;<em>Merciless</em>. &#xA0;<em>Cold-blooded</em>. &#xA0;<em>Hypocritical.</em>&#xA0; I have now described my <em>actual</em>&#xA0;motivations to you. &#xA0;To believe I am mistaken about them is one thing.  But you are, inadvertently, perhaps, describing a world where I <em>lack</em>&#xA0;motivation, or where I yearn only to slay and drink in the blood of my victims, and it additionally makes it seem as if you are ignoring everything I have said. &#xA0;You see how that could be taken as an insult,&#xA0;yes?&quot;<br>

-Ben, September 29

&quot;How could you <em>not</em> take that as an insult? He&apos;s called us blood-lustful monsters and compared us to the likes of <em>Hugo</em> and <em>Orcs.</em>&quot;<br><br>There is no trace of Ellie&apos;s earlier concern. Instead, her eyes betray a smoldering anger that contrasts sharply with the soft garlands and bouquets surrounding her.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;Would it have been more acceptable if the meeting had been in a warehouse and we hadn&apos;t broken into someone&apos;s home? That&apos;s assuming that the villa actually was theirs and they hadn&apos;t already been holding the owner hostage or killed them. I understand your issue with that&#x2014;next time, we&apos;ll knock, even though it will give away any tactical advantage we will have. So, changing the scenery and the method of entry, let&apos;s assume that they invite us in for a beer instead of murdering us on the street or taking us prisoner to find out who gave us information. I find it highly unlikely that they will tell us their plan of action and I will die before I hand over the Chains to people such as them. The <em>inevitable</em> fight breaks out and I will not negotiate when a sword is being pointed in the direction of my sister without any intent to yield. I have no regret for killing those men and will do it again if the situation arises. If we choose not to involve ourselves, who&apos;s to say the cult has not infiltrated the authorities and, by notifying them, we put ourselves, and anyone we are in contact with, in greater danger. There have already been multiple attempts to murder members of our group and you even implying we have anything in common with people trying to outright kill us for asking the wrong questions insults me greatly.&quot;<br><br>Ellie starts plucking the blossoms off some of the flowers Ursi has given her and laying them on the table. She mutters angrily under her breath as she inspects the bouquet.<br><br>&quot;...can&apos;t even... murderers... how absurd...&#xA0;bring a child... us...&quot;&#xA0;

Oi chuckles at the commotion that Nox makes clammering onto Grace&apos;s shoulder and is grateful to the tiny creature for cutting some of the tension in the room.<br><br>He rubs the bridge of his nose and opens his mouth to kindly retort to Grace once again, thoroughly enjoying their discussion, when he&apos;s interrupted by Ellie&apos;s outburst. He stares momentarily in Ellie&apos;s direction, trying to keep track of her train of thoughts and remember what Grace said as well. He&apos;s left with the distinct impression that although her words <em>seem</em> benign and almost playful she&apos;s definitely not in the mood to be trifled with.<br><br>As Ellie starts to dissect her flower collection, he tossles his hair and sighs deeply. <br><br>Once composed he begins, &quot;Grace, I&apos;m not sure I follow what you mean. I&apos;ve not said anything about anyone&apos;s individual motivations or even our motivations as a group. I&apos;ve not mentioned intent or bloodthirsty yearnings or anything like that. I&apos;ve simply spoken out about my interpretations of our actions as a group in battle earlier today. Can you clarify for me what you&apos;re construing as insulting? Perhaps we&apos;ve had a misunderstanding somewhere. To be sure, I <em>do</em> understand your point that asking someone to surrender before every attack is cumbersome and silly. I&apos;m not asking you for that. What I&apos;m begging of you all is that we try to avoid killing people, no matter how damned they are, unless we&apos;re provoked. Life is precious and taking it should be an act of desperation not a path of least resistance. We can&apos;t comprehend the far reaching impact of bringing death but, barring extraordinary circumstances, it is strikingly final.&quot;<br><br>He turns his focus to Ellie, &quot;Ellie, I pity your lack of remorse after killing, what with being so affected by death at such a young age and professed veneration of Rumaro&apos;s twin, I would have bet that you would have a greater appreciation for the miracle that is life. Additionally, I don&apos;t appreciate your attempt to reduce my logical points to absurdity. Those types of endeavor only show a lack of a cogent argument on your part. It doesn&apos;t serve to undermine my points at all. In fact, I fear you&apos;ve completely missed the point. Whether people are in a warehouse, a villa, the street, or jail, bringing death isn&apos;t something to enter into on a whim. Furthermore, whether someone has offered you a beer or poison, if they attempt to harm you or someone you love, there&apos;s nothing wrong with exerting appropriate force to influence them to change. However, bringing death isn&apos;t something to celebrate or be proud of. Taking life is regrettable, no matter the state of that life. I&apos;m sure someone of your age has felt the sting death can visit. Bearing that in mind, I would have expected you to have a greater perspective and wisdom regarding these matters. The belief that we are allowed to judge and kill on that judgement without provocation is naively haughty at best and intentionally arrogant at worst. If you truly have a <em>reason</em> why you believe we are able to accurately judge others and administer death outside of the law, I&apos;d love to hear it. Just to be clear, &apos;Because I&apos;m getting paid&apos; is not a valid reason. Mercenaries and sellswords get paid but that gold doesn&apos;t absolve them of their crimes or insulate their actions from being morally <em>wrong</em>. As for the cult&apos;s probable infiltration of the authorities and the establishment, you can&apos;t live life based upon a fear of uncontrollable consequences. Fear is not an excuse for failing to do the right thing. Maybe if we had notified the authorities they would have located a mole in their midst and we could&apos;ve aided in taking out a number of their personnel and a piece of their intelligence network. We&apos;ll never know what might have been because we acted prematurely. Speculating about what might have been and an argument that rests on such uncertainties is not very strong.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lastly, I&apos;m not <em>implying</em> that we have anything in common with these cultist, I&apos;m <em>saying </em>we <em>did</em> have something in common with them tonight. According to you and Grace they attempt to kill when people confront them and ask the wrong questions. You&apos;ve each mentioned attacks on members of our group and I&apos;m sure that we&apos;re not the only ones they&apos;ve attempted to silence. According to my observation of our actions tonight, we don&apos;t just <em>attempt</em> to kill people when they oppose us, we <em>succeed.</em> I don&apos;t mean to say that we are evil. I mean to say that both the cultist and our group act outside the law, and again, objectively, kill others. Killing for good is an oxymoron and a fallacy. Killing is bad. End of story. Death brings only more death and destruction. If you sow that kind of misery throughout life surely somewhere down the line, sooner or later, you will become a harvester of sorrows. I would urge everyone to protect life and happiness and hopefully reap that reward instead.&quot;

&quot;You described our actions as merciless and cold-blooded. &#xA0;You called&#xA0;us&#xA0;as a <em>bloodthirsty mob.</em>&#xA0; Oi, if that remains your assessment of what happened last night, you cannot honestly tell me that you&apos;ve been listening to me. &#xA0;In what way did we deny them mercy? &#xA0;We cannot give quarter to those who ask for none. &#xA0;In what way could we <em>possibly</em>&#xA0;have been cold-blooded? &#xA0;It was a <em>battle</em>, sprung by surprise and full of fury and passions. &#xA0;Bloodthirsty? &#xA0;<em>You understand what these words mean, right?</em>&quot;<br><br>Grace reaches up to scratch Nox under her chin, eyeing Oi with sour interest.<br><br>&quot;I am not going to waste my time on maudlin fictions, Oi. &#xA0;Call me what I am&#x2014;and if you honestly think it&apos;s <em>merciless, cold-blooded,</em>&#xA0;<em>bloodthirsty egomaniac</em>, then we have nothing more to talk about.&quot;<br>

Ellie looks up from her flowers, a bloom halfway to the table in her hand. She sets it down slowly with calculated movements and returns her hands to the bouquet. When she speaks, her tone is as icy as the color of her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Let me be quite clear, Oi. I am no mercenary. A mercenary has no ethics, no moral code; they are bound by gold and gold alone. I spend my life trying to help people who cannot help themselves, sometimes by bringing Death to meet those who readily deserve it, whether I am paid in gold or solely the honor of doing something right.&#xA0;I may takes the lives of people and creatures but my judgment is all I have that differentiates me from a cold-blooded murderer. I rely on it to tell me whether I <em>should</em> take the assignment, not solely if I can. I will not murder families who have slighted one of their own or incarcerate poverty-stricken children who have stolen from the wealthy, regardless of how much money I could make. I&#xA0;try to listen to The Harvester, call for her guidance on occasion but I am no woman of faith. I base my decisions on what I know from past experiences and how I handled previous situations; with that, I find myself worthy to judge. I am not infallible but I believe I am doing well enough. Essentially, you have told me that my judgment, my moral compass, means nothing.&quot;&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;I fully understand my actions. I fully understood what I was fighting when orcs brutally took a battleaxe to my beloved right in front of me, without mercy and without provocation. I live with the effects of that everyday and realize that every life I cull to meet Death, no matter how evil it is, ripples outward into the lives left behind. There is nothing to be celebrated about that. The effect is not always bad and, based on my judgment, I hope that the scales will be tipped in the favor of good and light with each kill, but sometimes there are unintended consequences. That people would worship through sacrifice without cause and revel in the pain of others is one of the reasons I find the Cult so despicable and worth meeting the other end of my arrows. I&apos;m surprised Grace said that she had no intention of sending their souls to meet Thania when we came to the house because that had been exactly what I intended.<br><br>&quot;Death is not to be taken lightly but it is necessary to maintain a balance we, as people and elves, need.&#xA0;I have seen first hand the happiness and relief that comes with tormentors being brought to justice, a justice that the authorities could not, or would not, provide. To say I am without reason in my choices on who deserves death is untrue and being able to aid innocent people in their personal dealings with evil has alone made my life worth something.&#xA0;I understand that my judgment is insufficient for you to accept my decisions, but that is what sets me apart from those who murdered my love, and it means everything to me.&quot;<br>

Oi sighs, tired from arguing a belabored point with no prospect of either of his companions relenting or conceding what he believed was a relative truism. <em>I guess &quot;killing people is bad&quot; isn&apos;t as universally accepted as I thought, </em>he muses to himself. &#xA0;He takes a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. Clearly he&apos;d touched on an emotional subject and he&apos;d need to choose his next words carefully. <br><br>&quot;Ellie, I&apos;m heartbroken that your love was taken from you. We elves typically believe that we have eternity together. I&apos;m sorry that Death stole that privilege from you. Some things in life are more important than discussing morality. Words cannot describe my sorrow for your loss.&quot; He bows his head deeply to her in conveyance of his emotions and drinks some of his mead to pause the conversation a second in honor of Maithiral&apos;s memory.&#xA0;<br><br>After the pause, he turns, and with ernest kindness begins to speak with Grace again. His tone is free from malice and it&apos;s clear that he does not wish this conversation to dissolve into an irreparable schism within the group. &quot;Grace, I do understand what those words mean&quot;, Oi says calmly with a bit of remorse touching his words. &quot;Bloodthirsty typically carries the connotation of someone who is eager to shed blood. Cold-blooded and merciless can be used interchangeably but usually convey a sense of emotionless action. As for maudlin, well that evokes sentiments of self-pity. I do pity myself and all of us for acting in the manner we did but I don&apos;t believe that it is in any way due to fiction. I recall the battle thusly: We picked the lock on their back door and, after getting impatient, attempted to see into their room. The watchman there, clearly alerted to our presence, surprised us and attacked Ielenia right as she looked through the door. We retaliated and quickly gained the upper hand and the more advantageous territory, thanks in large part to Ellie&apos;s sharp shooting. Roan and Illyrio came in through the front door allowing us to flank the cultists and surround them. I ran around the house and helped to clear out the back room. By that time we clearly had the upper hand in territory and numbers. Finally, you ran outside the house and shot fire through the window downing several of the men and that was pretty much the end of it. Before I go any further can we agree that this is pretty much what happened? Please feel free to supplement anything I may have overlooked.&quot; He ends his recount earnestly, clearly trying to smooth the tension in the group, and bring his own happy and empathetic demeanor to bear on the conversation.<br><br>He turns his attentions warily to Ellie, wanting to give Grace time to mentally go through the battle herself. &quot;Ellie, I&apos;m happy that you believe death is not to be taken lightly. Death and life are in a delicate balance and you cannot have either without the other. I am surprised that even though you are able to comprehend the vague&#xA0;ripples of the death we cause, you are vain enough to believe that your judgment alone is sufficient to bring the finality of death. While I imagine that you have much experience in making these judgments, you&apos;ve lived and probably killed for a long time, Rumaro, whose teachings we all spat on tonight, teaches that life is sacred and that no one should take it away without good cause. I believe that taking life is only appropriate as a last ditch defense. It seems to me that your experience has led you to believe that bringing death is acceptable earlier on in an encounter. While this belief is probably more practical, and safer, than mine, I perceive bringing Death so early as weakness. Killing shows a lack of respect for a person&apos;s ability to change or the effects that life may have if allowed to persist. I absolutely abhor death. It is repugnant to my very core. Let me ask you this, how would you feel if a group of adventurers broke into your mother&apos;s house and, when your mother or Aran began to fight back, secured an even stronger strategic position inside the house? Then after that, someone from outside shot arrows into the house and killed your family for defending themselves and their home? Wouldn&apos;t you think the adventurers in the wrong? Wouldn&apos;t you call them merciless or bloodthirsty? Wouldn&apos;t you want revenge? Understand that what you may feel for your family, or your beloved, I feel for <em>all</em> living things, even ones as terrible as those cultists. I will promise you that, when Death is required, I will have no problem administering the killing blow but, until that time, I would beg us all to be the better people in any encounter and avoid senseless killing whenever possible.&quot; He looks up a Ellie with his big green eyes, &quot;Would you do me that honor?&quot;

Ellie blinks as Oi conveys his sympathies, caught off-guard by the sudden change in conversation. She crushes her bouquet to her chest when he pauses and carefully studies him as he drinks to her lost love. Confusion, and then heartache, replace some of her anger and she is only half-listening when he recounts the night&apos;s events to Grace yet again. <br><br>When he transitions back to address her, she notices him regarding her carefully as if she may snap at any moment. Any pride she felt at his mention of her skill with a bow evaporates when he calls her <em>vain </em>and, as he explains to her his belief that killing is a lack of respect for change, she cannot help but think of previous conversations with Grace. At the mention of her family being killed, she glances at&#xA0;Ielenia, her little sister, her little copper-haired fox, and his final request for her to honor his wishes, to respect him for his belief in Rumaro, is just too much for her in that moment.<br><br>Doubt briefly flickers across Ellie&apos;s face as Oi looks her in the eyes.<br><br>&quot;I need a drink. Anyone else need a drink?&quot;<br><br>Without waiting for a response, she places her flowers down gently on the table and heads to the bar. When she returns, she absently places a mug of water in Grace&apos;s general direction before she sits down with her own mug. Apprehension clouds her delicate features as she searches the bottom of her cup for answers for what feels like an eternity. <br><br>&quot;I&apos;m not making any promises, Oi.&quot;<br><br>Ellie took a drink and pulled her flowers back into her lap.<br><br>&quot;I&apos;ve been in this line of work for a long time. Long before I met Maithiral, which was longer than you&apos;ve been alive. We were together for seventy years and I&apos;d been learning how to hunt and track a hundred years before that. A slow evolution of my life has put me here as you see me and that will not just go away. I can tell you right now that I do not agree with your conclusion that all life is equal. I cannot even pretend to understand how you can feel the same appreciation of life for cultists and children alike but, if it is even a fraction of what I feel for my family, I will try to respect that. But I will not make any promises.&quot;

Nox adjusts, gripping Grace&apos;s cloak neckline with her feet, and swings to hang upside down against Grace&apos;s chest, wrapped up in her wings and peering out at the rest of the party around the table.<br><br>&quot;That is more or less exactly how it happened, which is why it surprises me that your interpretation continues to be so... creative.  I think your newest comparison to Ellie&apos;s family is, frankly, wrong, in the details you have chosen to elide from it. &#xA0;You cannot ignore that, in this scenario,&#xA0;I, or Aran, started a fight to the death without so much as a &apos;get out of my home.&apos; &#xA0;You cannot ignore that&#xA0;I and my entire family chose for it to be a fight to the death, to stand our ground and continue to attempt to slay the adventurers until we breathed our last.&quot;<br><br>Grace shrugs.<br><br>&quot;And yet you choose to ignore these things. &#xA0;You are ignoring my points, Oi. &#xA0;So, you know what? &#xA0;Fine. &#xA0;I leapt into the fight with veins cold as ice, devoid of mercy, and consumed by a thirst for cultist blood, if that&apos;s what you want to call it. &#xA0;And I&apos;d do it again. &#xA0;I&apos;ll endure your wildly exaggerated condemnations. &#xA0;The Gods know those are nothing new to me.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br><br>Grace leaves the table for the bar, where she introduces Nox to Nerwenye and apologizes for not having done so sooner.<br>

-Ben, October 06

Ellie opens her mouth to protest but Grace leaves the table before she can utter a word. She rubs her forehead in frustration and turns back to Oi. <br><br>&quot;You know she is not any of those things, don&apos;t you?&quot; She drops her hand back to her lap. &quot;You see us as the aggressors, taking innocent lives of people who happen to be cultists. I see a room full of malicious people who had their swords at our throats and made no effort to breathe so much as a &quot;stop&quot; when we entered. This would be a completely different matter had the people been unarmed or even asked us to leave, but I believe this makes no difference to you as lives were taken either way. I fear we will not see eye to eye on this; our perception of the event is too different. As I said before, I will try to respect your wishes in the future, however, I also ask that you place some of your faith in my experience. The Harvester is The Gardener&apos;s twin, no? Our ideals were meant to co-exist, not clash, and I believe we can both benefit from an addition to our own perspective. In the future, you should take more care with your words, young elf. To be compared to mercenaries and merciless murderers is not something anyone will respond well to, no matter if the argument you make is true or not.&quot;<br><br>Ellie regards Oi for a pause. &quot;Let me grab another drink... and see if I can talk to Grace.&quot; <br><br>She rises and heads to bar to find a space near her friend.<br><br>&quot;Well, she&apos;s one way to get free drinks.&quot; she says as she watches&#xA0;Nerwenye interacting with Nox.&#xA0;Ellie does not sit, frankly unsure if she is welcome, but sets her mug on the bar for the bartender to refill. When Nerwenye leaves to fill her cup, she addresses Grace as she leans on the bar.<br><br>&quot;I don&apos;t think bloodthirsty murderous types get a familiar as cute as Nox.&quot; She cranes to see the tiny bat and then turns to Grace. &quot;Are you going to be okay? &#xA0;I&apos;m at least half as upset as you right now, so I can understand if you want some time to yourself, but we will need to talk eventually. In addition to the conversation we just had, there&apos;s the matter of a little girl to discuss.&quot;

-Nicole, October 06

Grace isn&apos;t sure what to do with her facial expression, so she drops her eyes to Nox, who herself watches Nerwenye work from the edge of the bar with great curiosity.<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah.  I&apos;m fine... I just left because don&apos;t see the point of talking. &#xA0;You heard Oi&#x2014;I did something that doesn&apos;t square with his ridiculous dogma, so no matter what my reasons or what the circumstances, I must have acted like a senseless monster, with all of the attendant senselessly monstrous attributes, and he won&apos;t hear anything to the contrary.&quot;<br><br>Grace smiles at Nerwenye and turns to Ellie.<br><br>&quot;Do you really think there&apos;s something to be gained from arguing with him about... anything, really?&quot;<br>

-Ben, October 07

---

Ellie shrugs.<br><br>&quot;Doesn&apos;t seem like it, does it? He&apos;s young, idealistic, and appears to be blind to the understanding that death is necessary. I mean, he compared what I do to&#xA0;<em>mercenary </em>work.&quot;<br><br>She softly kicks the bar with the toe of her boot.<br><br>&quot;I don&apos;t understand the veneration of all life; there are far too many depraved people in this world. Then again, I don&apos;t understand the worship of Death either.&#xA0;I feel no regret for our actions and I don&apos;t believe you acted monstrously in any fashion. We did what had to be done, which was protect our family and friends. I will respect his wishes when, at some point in the future, there is a situation where surrender is a viable option. If that time comes, I will attempt to keep my mind open for that alternative. I tried to remind him of the balance of Life and Death that our gods have created but I&apos;m not sure he understands that I will not lay down my bow at the feet of an armed adversary.&quot;<br><br>Ellie leans on her elbows and pulls her garland through her fingers while she waits for her drink.<br><br>&quot;We cannot continue arguing but I don&apos;t see how this discussion can resolved. I asked him to take more care in his word choice and try to offer our views the same respect he requests. Beyond that, the only thing Oi and I have agreed on is Abigail, albeit for different reasons. As to how he will respond to our future encounters with the cultists, your guess is as good as mine.&quot;<br>

-Nicole, October 07

Ursinalia was pleased to see everyone dressed in flowers. Then frowns slightly as the smiles fade and the group begins to argue again. <em>Well i&apos;m not going to let their grim moods upset mine today, no point in getting in the middle of an argument between Ellie and Oi. I&apos;ll probably hear both sides of it later, not that I even know what happened in there to begin with!&#xA0;<br><br></em>Ursinalia grabbed a few of the blooms that Ellie had crumpled and whisked them away to another seat near the hearth. Using a little bit of magic Ursinalia revived the poor flowers back to their full glory and began placing them in her hair. After a few minutes she felt a not so subtle tugging from the back of her head and whirled around to catch a small arm pulling out a flower. <br><br>&quot;No no dear that&apos;s not your flower, see it&apos;s all the wrong color for you, you are not a white bloom but maybe a yellow instead?&quot; Ursinalia reaches for another crumpled bloom and uses some druid craft to restore it and gently places it in the half elf child&apos;s hair. <br><br>&quot;There, see that suits you much better! Now sit and tell me who you are bold one?&quot; Ursinalia Said as she guided the little girl to sit beside her with a gentle but firm grasp so she could not leave her company.&#xA0;

-Amber  F., October 07

The little half-elven girl sat, uncomfortably in the spot Ursinalia set her upon. She glanced to Ielenia using her eyes to plead her case. Seeing Ielenia was unwilling to help her out of this mess, she spoke up, &quot;My name is Abigail. And your&apos;s is Ursi.&quot;

-James, October 07

Nerwenye returns and is immediately beset by a fruit bat licking eagerly at her hands for whatever cider she must smell on them. &#xA0;Grace responds to Nerwenye&apos;s polite consternation with a stifled laugh, scooping up Nox and holding her close.<br><br>Grace turns back to Ellie when Nerwenye has left earshot.<br><br>&quot;Thanks for trying to get through, Ellie. &#xA0;I figure... the next time we run into the cult they&apos;re unlikely to let us retread this conversation. &#xA0;They lost six or seven men tonight; I bet that&apos;s going to force them into hasty action. &#xA0;But if we do get the drop on them... well, I suppose Oi is welcome to knock on the front door and greet the evil murdering fanatics face-to-face, if that&apos;s what will make him happy. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t stand there and let them kill him; I&apos;m not nearly that vindictive. &#xA0;If he&apos;d prefer to get &apos;the authorities&apos; involved... well, let&apos;s be glad I chose to sideline&#xA0;<em>that</em>&#xA0;argument tonight. &#xA0;But, like I said, forced hands, hasty action... the urgency will probably give us an easy out on that one. &#xA0;Probably.<br><br>&quot;So we shouldn&apos;t have any problems. &#xA0;And as for our new friend, I still think... oh.&quot;<br><br>Grace turns to see Ursi adorning Abigail with a bright yellow flower.<br><br>&quot;... I guess that&apos;s good. &#xA0;She is nothing if not timely, yes?&quot;

-Ben, October 07

---

Ellie&apos;s confusion resolves when she see Ursi sitting with Abigail.&#xA0;She runs a hand through her hair.<br><br>&quot;First, my sister. Then, you. Now, my <em>girlfriend</em>?&quot;<br><br>She swore in Elvish, picks up the drink Nerwenye has left for her and takes a swig.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;I don&apos;t understand why you are all so insistent on her coming with us. I thought at least you would&#xA0;see my side of things.&#xA0;I&apos;ve been here, I&apos;ve made this decision before. It worked out so much better for Roan that I did not bring him with me. It was a split-second decision, and it caused a lot of fights on my end of things but I stand by that it was the best choice. He turned out to be a <em>good </em>kid, in every sense of the word, and he stayed safe until he was able to make his own choices. Abigail can survive here and, when she is old enough, leave with her own adventuring party. She knows the routes around town, who to trust, where to sleep. It&apos;s too dangerous for a child to come with us,&quot; her voice drops to a whisper, &quot;especially considering our future travel plans to a certain volcano. I understand she has taken a liking to Ielenia and wants to travel with her, but she is too young to understand the consequences of her decision.&quot;<br><br>Ellie scans the bar to see if she can find her sister&#xA0;and rests her eyes on Ursinalia and Abigail again. Her face softens the longer she watches them. After taking another drink, she swirls her index finger in her drink and holds it out to Nox.<br><br>&quot;Maybe Ursi will see my point, since right now the only sane people appear to be Illyrio and myself.&quot;<br>

-Nicole, October 08

Grace gives Ellie a <em>look</em>.<br><br>&quot;Oh, come on. &#xA0;After what I just sat through, you&apos;re going to call me insane, as if I suggest she come along without reason? &#xA0;You jest, but the implications rankle.&quot;<br><br>Nox stretches to reach Ellie&apos;s finger and gives it a few licks. &#xA0;She gives a tilt of her head, choosing to continue sniffing curiously rather than try to lick the rest of the flavor off. &#xA0;Too strong, perhaps?<br><br>&quot;Living like that in a city like this is rife with danger. &#xA0;I did the same thing she&apos;s doing when I was a child. &#xA0;One wrong move and she becomes some fat general&apos;s chambermaid for the rest of her life. &#xA0;Or someone even less likable decides they need a servant. &#xA0;Or she runs an errand for the wrong crowd or witnesses the wrong crime and ends up dead.<br><br>&quot;I do see your side of things. &#xA0;I admit that our road is treacherous for a child.&#xA0; But the street urchin&apos;s life is, too. &#xA0;If the road is the peril she desires, I say we let her have it.&quot;

-Ben, October 08

Ellie tears her gaze from Ursinalia and Abigail to face Grace.<br><br>&quot;Grace,&quot; she says seriously, &quot;you know I don&apos;t think you&apos;re insane and, I&apos;m sorry, that was not what I meant to imply. Please don&apos;t forget that I just endured the same chastisement you did and you know me better than to think I would purposefully insult you after that.&quot;<br><br>She notices Nox no longer licking the beer.<br><br>&quot;Poor thing,&quot; she coos as she stoops closer to Nox&apos;s face, &quot;It <em>is </em>bitter, isn&apos;t it? Have these instead.&quot; Ellie stands upright, pulls some bright red berries out of her belt pouch and presents them in an open hand to the tiny claws.<br><br>Ellie returns to Grace&apos;s crimson stare, her voice solemn again.<br><br>&quot;I understand your point. I do not want to be here any longer than we have to be and the thought of leaving a child in this place disgusts me for all the reasons you have mentioned. The city where I was raised is not like this. Mine is an elven one, full of trees and color and harmony; a lifetime away from this dusty city, full of pain and death. My home is at peace so, unlike you, I did not endure this kind of life as a child. But I do understand the road and the perils that lay in wait for us there.&#xA0;I fear that if we take her, we will not be able to protect her as we need to. There are so many things to watch for, things that even skilled healers cannot fix. What will she do if we are attacked, or while we are walking on the road for weeks?&quot;<br><br>She shifts her weight uncomfortably but doesn&apos;t look away.<br><br>&quot;If I had taken Roan with me, he would have been killed right by Maithiral&apos;s side and I would have had to live with both their deaths instead of mourning one. I don&apos;t wish to live out that possibility with this little girl.&#xA0;Is there nowhere in this town that we could take her where she would be safe instead of taking her with us?&quot;

-Nicole, October 08

&quot;Sorry, I... misjudged your tone. &#xA0;It seemed so much more serious a second ago than it does in retrospect... ugh. &#xA0;I do know you better than that.&quot;<br><br>Grace rubs her forehead and runs that hand back through her hair.<br><br>&quot;I don&apos;t know... I don&apos;t know. &#xA0;Maybe there are safe places around here? &#xA0;It sure doesn&apos;t feel like it. &#xA0;Being an orphan&#x2014;a poor orphan, without money or an &apos;important&apos; name&#x2014;is such an easy way to become a slave. &#xA0;A cheap slave at that, because there&apos;s none of the... prestige... blech... that comes from being taken in a war or a raid. &#xA0;So I&apos;m not sure if there actually are any places that shelter orphans in Heliopis... and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d trust them if they existed.<br><br>&quot;The Temple, maybe, if we can wash her up a bit. &#xA0;She&apos;s bright; she could certainly learn to read and become a Sister of the priesthood. &#xA0;I know, I know... devotee of&#xA0;Thania, maybe not what you had in mind. &#xA0;Not what I would have in mind either... and I doubt it&apos;s what she has in mind, most of all. &#xA0;But maybe we should ask her? &#xA0;As much as the idea might bother me, I shouldn&apos;t presume that she is as allergic to... fealty... as I am.&quot;<br><br>Grace looks over to try to catch everyone else&apos;s eyes, particularly Ursi&apos;s. &#xA0;This movement takes Nox just out of reach of the berries, so the bat bounces out of her arms and onto Ellie&apos;s to chomp down on a berry. &#xA0;Grace breaks a smile.<br><br>&quot;Don&apos;t spoil her too much, now.&quot;

Ursinalia follows the girl&apos;s gaze as it alights on Ielenia with curiosity and the shock as she hears her own name come out of the girl&apos;s mouth. she moves her grip to the girls right hand and tightens it.&#xA0;<br><br>Trying not to sound phased by the girl&apos;s odd knowledge, &quot;Well you must very wise to know so much but I wonder what else you know? Like for example can you do this?&quot;&#xA0;<br><br>Ursinalia draws on her magic again and creates a small whirlwind of green leaves, that fall gently around the girls head swirling in front of her eyes like they are dancing. While the girl is distracted with the falling leaves that seem to disappear as they hit the ground, Ursinalia looks up to try to catch Ellie&apos;s eye. <em>Maybe Ellie or Ielenia will know what to do with this girl, or know something more about her?&#xA0;</em><br><br>

Ellie notices the movement of the swirling leaves out of the corner of her eye and sees Ursinalia trying to get her attention. She gently returns Nox to Grace&apos;s shoulder and pushes some of the berries into the tiefling&apos;s hand. Motioning for her to follow, she glides across the tavern to the pair&#xA0;and sits down next to Ursi. She lightly touches the flowers in her hair. <br><br>&quot;I&apos;m happy you were able to make the flowers beautiful again. I didn&apos;t mean to crush your gifts; I will tell you about that later.&#xA0;I see you&apos;ve met our friend, Abigail. &#xA0;I was hoping to talk to you before you two met but I see she has found you first. She has been quite helpful with our... adventure today.&quot;<br><br>She smiles warmly at the little girl.<br><br>&quot;The flower is beautiful in your hair, little one. Yellow is the perfect color for you. It is late for one so young. Would you like some dinner?&quot;<br><br>Ellie calls out to Ielenia across the bar and waves for her sister and the rest of their party to join them.&#xA0;Turning back to Ursinalia, and giving Abigail time to choose what to eat,&#xA0;she tries to keep her face neutral when she relays their quandary in hushed tones. <br><br>&quot;Abigail has expressed interest in coming with our party when we leave from here. Grace and I have discussed it at length and have our own ideas but I&apos;m curious as to your thoughts.&quot;<br>

Abigail nods, &quot;Isn&apos;t everyone always hungry?&quot; She listens to as Nerwenye presents the menu and selects a bit of everything, mixing and matching main courses and side dishes as she pleases.<br><br>&quot;Well, Ielenia did tell me I couldn&apos;t go to Protsvitaly. And I don&apos;t want to stay here forever. So then where else am I supposed to go?&quot;

&quot;Hm well she seems very resourceful. How did she help you earlier? It may be a problem feeding her is she continues to eat that much!&quot; Ursinalia chuckles lightly, then pauses for a moment to consider the little girl.&#xA0;<br><br>Then more seriously &quot;Does she not have a family in Heliopis? I guess she would probably be better of in an Elf village where children are cherished rather than enslaved. I think it would only be right of us to make sure she is well taken care of, especially in a place as big and brutal at this one is. I do not think it would be much trouble to escort her to a safe place and who better to protect her than us! Especially with you around she&apos;d be much safer than alone anywhere..and who could you trust more than your sister and your beautiful new lover to help you care for her, not to mention Oi&apos;s abilities that seem to get stronger every day! I bet you could teach her so much too, I mean a few months with you and Ielenia and she&apos;d be able to defend herself marvelously. Really I can&apos;t think of a better person to look out for her than you, Ellie, you already do such a great job being there for your sister. I know you talked about having to leave Roan with the priests but this is different, &#xA0;I think. Abigail is not an infant, she could easily be taught to avoid vulnerable situations and you have all of us here to help you this time! &#xA0;And seriously who checks under the Wolf or Bear for a child? Nobody! &quot; Ursinalia is talking quickly and excitedly at the prospect of taking care of the little girl. &#xA0;&#xA0;

Ellie&apos;s eyes widen in surprise the longer Ursinalia talks, chewing thoughtfully on her lip while she ponders her hopeful suggestions.&#xA0;<br><br>She takes Ursi&apos;s hands in hers and says tenderly, &quot;The road we are to travel is so dangerous. She may be older than Roan but she is still a child even by human standards. I could carve her a bow in her size and buy her a dagger but she will still need training and I&apos;m not sure the road is the place for that. I would prefer for her to live in a village of Elves rather than this place of brutality but there aren&apos;t any around here for miles. If we were to bring her to one, we will need to travel for weeks by ship,&quot; she flinches reflexively, &quot;or longer if we went on foot. And once we arrive, where will she go then? We can not stay and raise her ourselves until we have finished our journey and I am reticent to leave her alone in yet another village. The Prince and Princess might have an idea where we could bring her but I&apos;m not sure they will care about just one more starving half-elf child in a place like this. Grace and I discussed that The Temple of Thania might be safe if she were to become a Sister. She could travel like Oi once she comes of age and she would be safer there than traveling across the continent. <em>Melamin,</em> you would truly like to bring her along with us?&quot;<br><br>Ellie turns to Abigail, who is now surrounded by ridiculous amounts of food, and the sight brings a smile to her face. She&#xA0;tries to hide the edge in her voice as she speaks about the Temple.<br><br>&quot;I&apos;m sorry to interrupt your dinner, Abigail, but what do you think about living in the Temple? You would have clothes and food, be able to learn about anything you wanted and you would be safe. Ielenia was correct when she said you cannot go to Protsvitaly but it might be too dangerous to bring you with us.&quot;<br>

Abigail&apos;s delightful mood turn sour quickly, she pushes the current plate aside. &quot;No.&quot; she states matter-of-factly, &quot;I won&apos;t go back to them. I&apos;d rather stay at the Docks.&quot;

-James, October 10

&quot;We can&apos;t let her live at the docks!&quot; Ursinalia says with disgust and shock.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;No one should be forced to join a worship they don&apos;t truly believe in.&#xA0;Yes, truly I think it will be okay, perhaps we can find a place appropriate for her on the way to destroy the chains, that volcano isn&apos;t close is it? There is bound to be an elf village on the way, right? &quot;&#xA0;

Oi has sauntered over to the group sometime in all the hubbub.&#xA0;<br><br>&quot;Child or not,&quot; he says warily, &quot;she <em>is</em>&#xA0;resourceful and quite skilled. Furthermore, she&apos;s been an invaluable asset since she&apos;s made her presence known&#xA0;to us. Maturity wise she&apos;s not far behind me and while I do have a couple more decades of experience to draw from, I&apos;m sure her time on the street has accelerated her maturation. I&apos;m positive&#xA0;she wouldn&apos;t be a burden on us in our travels and who knows, she might even unwittingly teach us a thing or two about life along the way.&#xA0;I am sure she would be in less danger with us than she would be alone in this place.&quot; He sighs, &quot;In sort, I vote she accompany us and we protect her.&quot;<br><br>He smiles warmly at the girl, &quot;Just try not to pick up any of our bad habits, ok?&quot;

Ellie&apos;s surprise at Oi&apos;s agreement was plain.<br><br>&quot;Oi...&quot;, she says with bewilderment, as she turns back to Ursinalia.<br><br>&quot;No, no, we won&apos;t let her live at the Docks.&#xA0;I&apos;m also not forcing her to join any devotion without her agreement, especially not the Temple of Thania, but it was important to offer her the option.&quot; <br><br>Ellie pushes another plate of food towards Abigail and sighs with resignation as she looks from her to Oi and Grace and finally to Ursinalia.<br><br>&quot;We will have to get her cleaned up and properly prepared for the journey. I can adjust my short bow to fit her frame until we find her an appropriate weapon. Perhaps Ielenia can talk to her about when stealing things is appropriate as well and why we don&apos;t steal from friends. I still think we should speak with the Prince and Princess and see if they know of a village that is close enough that would help her. She cannot come with us to the volcano&#x2014;I will not be swayed on that&#x2014;but, if it will make you happy, Ursi, we can help find somewhere better for her to grow up.&quot;<br>
