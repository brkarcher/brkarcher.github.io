Second Seeker Llwch and Fourth Seeker Gwyn the Gold are ending a conversation when Roan and Mhares are ushered into the chamber in the Citadel, located in the Sword District.<br><br>This is large room, it&apos;s main function holding conference or war planning. A long table dominates the room. A map of the world spread across it.<br><br>Llwch turns to greet the newcomers, &quot;Greetings Champions. What brings you to the Citadel?&quot;

Roan steps forward to reply &quot;Sir, we bring some new information to you about the possible identity of the man who appeared to be leading the orc army.&quot; and immediately steps back behind Mhares who is holding the gauntlet. (At least he probably should be. Roan would not want to touch it.)

Mhares hands the gauntlet to gwyn, &quot;We saw the man wearing this black armor during the battle. This morning we visited the docks here and were able to retrieve the gauntlet from the river. It appears the man was brought in on a barge wounded from battle andI believe is likely still in the city.&quot;

Llwch takes the gauntlet from Gwyn and goes over it a few times.<br><br>&quot;Seems pretty standard fare with a coat of black paint. Not sure there&apos;s much to go on here.&quot;<br><br>He sets the gauntlet down on the table, &quot;While I would very much like to bring that man to justice, there are far more pressing issues. The orcs have laid siege to Fort Green. We can evacuate most of the men there but we&apos;ll likely be ordering some to certain death to hold the gates while the rest escape.&quot;<br>

Llwch tosses the gauntlet onto the table and returns to his pacing and brooding.<br><br>Gwyn gathers Mhares and Roan together near the door, &quot;I apologize, this attack has caught us all by surprise and we&apos;re not well prepared. I do have an important request that I would like to make of you. I&apos;d like you to find a way to recover Artorigios&apos; body so that we may properly honor his life and death. Will you do this for me? For the Order?&quot;

-James, January 12

Mhares places a hand on Roan&apos;s shoulder. &quot; We would be honored to do this for you and for the Order.&quot;

-Amber  F., January 13

Roan wipes a tear away from his eye, and finally finds his voice. &quot;Absolutely. If there is anything I can do for the Order, I will do it. When should we depart? If possible, I will take my vows before we depart. And I might add where? Do you believe the hoard would have had any reason to keep Artorigios&apos;s body or should it still be where he fell?&quot;

-Carolyn M., January 15

Gwyn grabs the gauntlet and guides Roan and Mhares out of the room.<br><br>&quot;It will likely be near where it fell. Though there&apos;s no telling what those foul beasts would do.&quot;<br><br>She hands the gauntlet back to Roan, &quot;Bring him back. And find his killer. Complete this task and I will administer your oath personally.&quot;<br>
