Ellie&apos;s arrow barely grazes enough of the hilt to knock the dagger out of the air and it clatters to the floor. She beams as she lowers her bow.<br><br>&quot;I think you were holding back on that other one. That dagger was closer to dwarves running towards a platinum-plated turkey on a bed of gems.&quot; She laughs heartily as she grabs her sister&apos;s dagger and the arrows from the target. &quot;Anyone against heading back to the inn? We&apos;ve been here all night with no trace of anyone. I&apos;m sick of waiting and <em>someone</em> owes me a beer.&quot;<br><br>Ellie hands Ielenia her dagger with a smile and slings her pack over her shoulder to head back to the Red Bear.<br>

&quot;Hell, Ielenia, If I had to wear a millstone around my neck for <em>five years</em>&#xA0;every time I had a regret... well, I&apos;d probably have slid into a ditch and died there with all that weight.&quot;<br><br>Grace warms up her hands, lines up her shots, and arcs a trio of <em>fire bolts</em>&#xA0;into the target, smiling as the flaming projectiles impact and wash over it one after the other.<br><br>&quot;I was never much for precision anyway. &#xA0;Say, I&apos;ll catch up to you at the Bear. &#xA0;I&apos;ve been working on a spell I want to try out tonight... don&apos;t worry, if anyone shows up, I can just vanish.&quot;
