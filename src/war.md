War is two things.

First, war is the continuation of politics by other means. In the purest political sense, war is not exactly about the killing. War is simply what it is called when a large enough group (usually a state) has goals that cannot be achieved unless a bunch of people who will try to stop them are killed.

Second, war is immense human misery. It is grief on a scale we can't comprehend. Parents lose their children, brothers their sisters, uncles their nephews. It's the pain of every friend you've ever known who lost someone before their time, or perhaps the pain you've felt yourself... tens or hundreds of thousands of times over.

A lot of us have gone on wild political journeys over the last few years. We woke up, or we changed allegiances, or we watched friends walk down strange paths. For mine, I started really, truly paying attention to politics for the first time and trying to make sense of it within the tradition of political philosophy. And I went left. Hard left. I've always been a culturally lefty kind of guy, and I think everyone knows that, but since 2016 it's become obvious that being squishy and vaguely culturally lefty is... insufficient. It was a weak conviction appropriate for a weak understanding of politics. More understanding, more reading, and more reflection have brought more clarity to me and helped me understand who does what with their political power, and as a result, a better appreciation for certain leftist ideas of how that power should be apportioned and ultimately attenuated.

All this is to say that there are a lot of leftists out there—the assorted socialists, anarchists, far-left liberals, DSA members, and communists—who are now mobilizing, agitating, and proposing solutions new and old to the problems that plague our society. And I have a great sympathy for them.

A lot of them talk about war.

This is an argument that's as old as leftism itself. Direct action or politically mediated action? Violent direct action or nonviolent direct action? Seize the means of production by force of arms or at the ballot box? Are these things mutually exclusive, or are they two arms of the same body?

As a newbie to the world of political philosophy, as a young man, and as a neophyte student of history, the only reasonable thing to do is usually to remain humble and receptive of arguments. But I can't here. War is *misery*. War is mass murder. War with even the most noble of aims empowers psychopaths, sadists, and opportunists. War will take your family away and bury them without a proper goodbye. War will break your friends and enemies alike, and it will scavenge the meat off their corpses.

And then at the end of it, Stalin might just end up at the top of the heap.

War is the continuation of politics by other means. But look what at what those politics are: dead loved ones, a world where monsters thrive, and power accorded to strength and the erratic tumbling of the iron dice—not to justice. If we pursue war, we conduct a politics that runs counter to everything we hold dear, and we should not be surprised when the war ends and no matter who holds the reins of power, our endeavor lies in ruin.

Instead, we should conduct our politics by the only means that will lead us to victory. We need to avert war *at all costs*. And that means fighting as hard as we can imagine, and then *harder*, to create a better world, to render inert the tensions in our society that could explode into violence. Global warming, the outrageous power that the wealthy wield over us and our society, xenophobic and racist fearmongering, the evil vortex of poverty and violence: we should fight all of these for their own sake, and we should also fight them because if we fail to, we will go to war over them.

The right wing violence in the last few days is not yet a war. Not by the usual standards, anyway. What are their goals? What is their victory condition? The honest answer to these questions is that the people conducting this "war" either have no aims beyond perverse personal satisfaction, or they are deluded and believe that they can achieve the eradication of minorities and democrats by sporadic, uncoordinated acts of evil.

As furious as you and I are and as desperately as we want to "fight back," we cannot eliminate lunatics or lunacy with sporadic acts of violence. No amount of punching nazis will usefully further your goals, other than perhaps to give you the warm and fuzzies. And indeed, organizing a true campaign of violence against them would not only fail, it would make it all worse as it failed.

The way to "fight back"—and win—is to understand our aims, understand how they might be achieved, devise a strategy, and then execute relentlessly. In brief: our aim is to end the violence. How might that be achieved? What causes the violence? The obvious factors seem to include the right-wing media ecosystem, wink-and-nod encouragement by prominent politicians, and a lack of peer pressure *against* it. How do we remove these factors? It won't be easy—if it were easy, we would have done it a decade ago—but there are things we can do. The beginning is to be yourself and be moral. Be an example for the people around you. Reject lunacy and conspiracy; reject political violence and murder. The people around you will notice. Social pressure is a strange and powerful thing. The next is to speak up. Project yourself. Let more people notice. Let more be influenced. Then? I don't know. Run for office. Go into journalism. Find a cause. Volunteer. Talk. Found a media company. Organize. You can't take down Fox News alone. But an organization might. Vote. Donate time. Donate money. Hell, slacktivize. Come up with better ideas than I have, because as you can tell I'm not particularly creative. Devise a means to hasten the end of the GOP and the right-wing media machine. Find a new way to erode the power of the wealthy.

Violence is a trap. Violence is their game. Violence furthers their goals, not ours. Fight in other ways. Fight to win.
