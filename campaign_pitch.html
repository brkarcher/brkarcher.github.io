	<body><h1>Campaign Pitch</h1>

<p>You have been members of the Huǒjù Jūn for a few years now, serving under the Prefect Lóngzhi.  You've become very good at what you do, to the point where Lóngzhi recognizes you as the best she has under her command.  As such, she has learned to trust you with work that demands long, risky journeys, autonomous decision-making, and decisive action.</p>

<p>The six of you—maybe you came to the Huǒjù Jūn all at once, or maybe you came to it in remarkably different ways—have grown comfortable with each other and with Lóngzhi's command.  Maybe this is the life you imagined, maybe it isn't, but either way, for a warrior's life it's been a life lived well.  Now, Lóngzhi has sent you on a mission to a remote western province, and our story begins.</p>

<h2>A Glossary</h2>

<h3>Huǒjù Jūn</h3>

<p>The Huǒjù Jūn is the Army of the Torch.  It is an elite, decentralized army established by the Shining Empire to combat the Wights and other threats to the Empire that the imperial standing armies are not well-suited to engage.  Members of the Huǒjù Jūn serve for life and are considered legally dead, given honorable symbolic burials before joining.</p>

<p>The Huǒjù Jūn serves alongside and apart from the Imperial Army.  The Imperial Army is the traditional institution of battle and glory and the main instrument in Jin-Mao Huang's wars.  The Huǒjù Jūn, in contrast, rarely fights wars, and therefore, rarely engages in pitched battles, and so as a result is organized much differently.  It can be thought of as being comprised of "chapters" throughout the empire.  The largest maintain garrisons of hundreds in the Empire's urban centers, where the smallest might be no larger than ten soldiers in a remote mountain town.</p>

<p>The "chapters" answer to the Torchbearers.  The Torchbearers are a select group of Mandarin, all of whom have achieved the degree of High Magistrate at the least.  These Torchbearers are often former soldiers or rangers themselves, familiar with either the tactical or the geographical concerns that their soldiers confront.  They correspond frequently, but are ultimately organized loosely, preferring to see defense as a local matter.  But the Huǒjù Jūn will, and has, come together as one army when Jin-Mao Huang directs it himself. </p>

<p>The soldiers of the Huǒjù Jūn are deeply honored but also regarded as an odd lot, much of this owing to their status as "dead."  It is by no means legally forbidden to speak with, befriend, or shelter one of the Huǒjù Jūn, but a great many people are made uncomfortable by the notion of a person being dead.  So the Huǒjù Jūn tend to turn inward, becoming close with each other and far from the society they protect.</p>

<h3>The Wights</h3>

<p>The Wights, also known as the Demon-touched or the Hellions, are the bane of every mortal on Materia.</p>

<p>The Wights are dead bodies, given evil un-life through demonic magic.  As such, they come in all the shapes and sizes that mortals do and, unfortunately, a few more.  Wights are as physically viable as mortals are: they can speak their host body's language, they are as fast and as strong as their body was in life, and, worst, they can produce offspring.  The destructive cunning of Hell ultimately causes them to leverage this to breed their host bodies into ever more capable forms.  Mature bands of Wights, over many generations, converge into terribly tall, broad-shouldered, muscular war machines.</p>

<p>Wights, as a whole, are clever and brutally cunning, but they are not intelligent.  They speak their languages through the reflexive pathways of their host bodies and not through any creative impulse.  They have no drive to build anything more complicated than the brute tools of war they employ and the simple shelters that keep them in condition to fight and destroy again the next day.</p>

<p>Much is mysterious about the Wights—their origin, the exact nature of the magic that animates them, how much they "remember" from life—but what is clear is that the bodies are husks whose souls have departed (or never existed, in the case of bred Wights).  Many powerful divine spells are wrought specifically to bring awesome destruction upon undead but fizzle impotently against the mystic properties of the Soul.  Wights, as they evidence no resistance to these undead-ravaging spells, are clearly no more than soulless puppets.</p>

<h3>The Mandarin</h3>

<p>The Mandarin are the imperial officials who carry out Jin-Mao Huang's will in his territories.  Any adult subject of sound mind and body is eligible to undergo the rigorous gauntlet of training and examinations which, if completed, allows one to be conferred the Mantle of the Mandarin.  The ceremony, performed by Jin-Mao Huang himself yearly, is ancient and magical: to "wear the Mantle" is to be transformed into a Dragonborn by this ceremony so that one may be physically (and symbolically) fit to serve as a conduit for the Emperor's authority.</p>

<p>The majority of the Mandarin work autonomously, guided by the empire's legal traditions and code of ethics, so there is little "hierarchy" to speak of.  However, the Mandarin do have a system of ranking.  One's rank depends mostly on the degree of learning attained, and a certain degree may be required to fulfill more prestigious duties.</p>

<p>The Mandarin, as a whole, have an academic bent, though most people are familiar with them as magistrates, judges, and prefects.  Many also serve as instructors, heralds, diplomats, assessors, and mathematicians.</p>
