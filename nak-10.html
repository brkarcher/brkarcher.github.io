	<body><p>To be, or not to be, that is the question: <br />
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer <br />
The Spears and Mallets of outrageous Fat Men, <br />
Or to lay down before the cozy bonfire, <br />
And by avoiding end them: to rage, to quit <br />
For good; and by a quit, to say we end <br />
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks <br />
Of Fat Man's butt slam? 'Tis a consummation <br />
Devoutly to be wished. To rage, to quit, <br />
To quit, perchance to Sleep; Aye, there's the rub, <br />
For in that bliss of sleep, what madness comes, <br />
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br />
Must give us pause. There's the respect <br />
That makes Calamity of cursed undeath: <br />
For who would bear the Pikes and Swords of Knights, <br />
The Giants' Halberds, the Fat Man's hammer strokes, <br />
The thrusts of Ornstein's Spear, the swift retreat, <br />
The glimmering of new hope, and the Doom <br />
That newborn dream with such swiftness meets, <br />
When he himself might his comfort make <br />
With idle Despair? Who would Armor bear, <br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary helm, <br />
But that the dread of madness after death, <br />
The assur√©d Hollowing, from whose bourn <br />
No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will, <br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have, <br />
Than fly to others that we know not of. <br />
Thus Conscience does make Heroes of us all, <br />
And thus the Native hue of Resolution <br />
Is re-emboldened, with the rich stain of Fear, <br />
And final battles of great pitch and moment, <br />
With this regard their Futures turn awry, <br />
And lose the promise of Defeat. Soft you now, <br />
Fat Smough and Swift Ornstein? Foes, in thy Trouncings <br />
Be all my deaths made worthy.  </p>
