	<body><h2>Gal Feinn</h2>

<p>Gal Feinn is one of the King's Dark Lanterns investigating Captain Arazka, operating out of Port Verge. Her proximity to the Diresharks and their trade networks makes her an important operative in the Lhazaaran theater.</p>

<hr />

<p>Gal possesses a strong sense of justice, contrasted deeply with built-up feelings of cynicism and ruthlessness, operating with the convictions of a true believer but availing herself to all the dirty methods and underhanded tools befitting a saboteur and assassin.</p>

<p>When Captain Arazka arrived in Regalport, Gal's superior, Testra, received Tyrn and arranged for his transfer to a Brelish prison. But she rightly suspected Arazka of foul play, and she immediately mobilized her assets to surveil him and informed Zia of her suspicions.</p>
