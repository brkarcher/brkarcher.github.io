<blockquote>
  <p>You get to know a warrior best in their last gasps, when they know their doom is coming at the hands of the better warrior. What do they do with the future ripped away, with only the crushing reality of the present to face up to?</p>

<p>I prefer to prolong these moments, myself.</p>

<p><em>Sadism</em> is a longsword of Valenar make, custom-forged and enchanted as a gift from Viondir Ulanel to his sister-in-arms, Delsanra Qindi. It was presented to her on the eve of a successful battle to finalize their joint conquest of the Phaelilurian Marches in Aerenal centuries ago. The sword has been passed down in the Qindi dynasty since.</p>
