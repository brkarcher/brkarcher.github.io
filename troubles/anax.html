	<body><h2>Anax Cheimon</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>My dear, it is all for naught. No horse nor its rider will bring back old Galifar. Not the Legions, not the Cuirassiers. They have all tried. They all, in turn, have failed.</p>

<p>I will not fail. I will bring back old Galifar with the fury of the heavens. I am heir to a power greater than any of the petty usurper Kings. I will raze their cities and break their castles with force that would turn the mightiest war wizards pale. I will give life to ancient Lhazaaran nightmares. I will embody Karrnathi sagas of conquest and bloodshed. I will make the Dhakaani Dirgesingers behold terror that transcends song.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anax Cheimon is a pseudonym borne by Magella Qindi, Warlord of Zephyr Keep.</p>

<p>Anax Cheimon—translated from an ancient Galifari dialect as "Lord of the Storms"—is a mysterious presence in Lhazaar. Here is what is known:</p>

<ul>
<li>Captain Tyrn received a letter, encoded in the XLVII Legion's cipher and signed by Anax Cheimon sometime in Aryth (the eleventh month) of 996. It ordered him to begin a smuggling operation whereby Tyrn and Captain Arazka would collaborate to ferry Dreamlily into Sharn, using it to buy Dragonshards from the Boromar Clan.  </li>
<li>Anax Cheimon replied to a letter from Testra ir'Gawaine mostly as a taunt. If the text is to be believed, however, the author of the letter gave away that they must be old enough to have been alive for the Battle of the Broken Ribs in 963 YK... and old enough at the time to grasp its meaning.  </li>
<li>Gal Feinn was able to decipher the meaning of the ritual handbook Biblio Notus seized from Prince Kolberkon's estate. It indicates that the ultimate recipient of the dragonshards is a woman with a human mother, born in the month of Eyre.  </li>
<li>Zia talked to a drunk tradesman who told her that someone using the name Anax Cheimon had threatened a famous blacksmith to make them a suit of Mithral plate, bearing a peculiar inscription on the inside of the collar: "to reclaim our lost honor."  </li>
