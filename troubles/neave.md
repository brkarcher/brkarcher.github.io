## Neave d'Jorasco

Neave d'Jorasco is an estranged daughter of the ancient and storied house Jorasco. She left ten years ago, to the great disappointment of her parents, over the suffocating, hidebound nature of the house's institutionsâ€”the council, the hierarchy, the rites of inheritance and of advancement. Struck by wanderlust, she left Vedykar for the sea, and found herself prized as a surgeon's mate... although she suspects many of her captains were disappointed that she didn't present them with any leverage over the resources of the House itself.

She was serving aboard a Karrnathi merchant with Camouflage when it was captured by the *Mercurial* and was pressed into service. She kept that crew in fighting shape for some time before Captain Arazka marooned her on Watchdog Isle in a fit of pique.
