## Captain Tyrn

Captain Loghan Tyrn is a stubborn man.

Born in 961 to a pair of Cyran soldiers, he lived most of his years in one garrison or another along the Brelish and Karrnathi borders. His favorite, by far, was Seaside. When his parents were sortied to march to battle, Tyrn remained at Seaside, watching ships come and go, sails catching the wind and regalia flapping in the salty breeze.

Tyrn was too poor and ill-connected to possibly attend Cyre's naval academy. Instead, he trained, as his parents had, as a soldier. And in 984, when his time came, he sortied with his army, which marched to Breland, where it was crushed by a numerically superior force commanded by one of Breland's most dangerous war wizards.

The next few years of his life are known to nobody but himself. But in 988 he led a small ragtag band of sailors, thieves, and saboteurs and commandeered the *Javelin* at port, renaming it the *Crown of Mishann* and sailing it to Seaside. There, he accepted a letter of marque and has been battling and capturing vessels under the Cyran flag ever since.

The Day of Mourning seems not to have changed this. Tyrn's gaze, if anything, hardened, and his efforts have redoubled, and he continues to sail under the Cyran flag. He scoffs at the Treaty of Thronehold and comports himself as a privateer sailing in the name of a shattered kingdom.

The only significant stretch of time he's spent on land since 988 was during a short period of ceasefire between Cyre and Breland, which Tyrn capitalized on by making port at Sharn and building resources and contacts there. One of those contacts was the changeling Midge whom he found himself smitten by. They married in late 992, shortly before hostilities resumed and Tyrn took the Crown out to sea.

At the turn of 998 YK, Captain Tyrn disappeared in suspicious circumstances, last seen rowing the Crown's longboat out to the Mercurial.
