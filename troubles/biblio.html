	<body><h2>Biblio Notus</h2>

<p>A leather-bound handbook, dense with magical notation. Several highly abstract theories are laid out and then tightly interrelated, making it extremely difficult to determine to what end they are being leveraged.</p>

<p>Gal Feinn, while she has had possession of the book, has added some significant notes in the margin, bringing a great deal of transparency to the entire ordeal.</p>

<p>The book is in two parts. The first describes a ritual whereby an eldritch machine may be used to transport materials over great distances to a specific recipient that the machine may be attuned to. The second describes a sacrificial ritual used to maintain the eldritch machine's attunement to a specific recipient without requiring the recipient's presence, as long as the ritual is conducted once yearly (preferably on the summer solstice).</p>

<p>The most interesting note is on the inside of the back cover:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note to Z:</p>

<p>This is a magical "dead drop" location disguised as Dark Six ritual. Provides deniability—who would think twice upon discovering that a pirate lord prays to Devourer in secret?</p>

<p>Clear that Anax Cheimon created this and instructed Arazka to use it to teleport dragonshards to her. This suggests that Anax dwells inland, where pirate smugglers cannot ordinarily deliver, or is truly > paranoid and unwilling to meet with anybody.</p>

<p>Key clue is on p. 31. Second ritual begins there and describes a "re-attunement" with properties specific to the recipient. Specifically, the recipient is a woman, born in the month of Eyre, to a human mother.</p>

<p>The power of this device suggests that Anax may possess the Mark of Making, but it seems impossible—you can name specifically who in House Cannith is capable of making this kind of thing, and even in Cannith > East none of them have the Lhazaaran contacts necessary to place the device in Kolberkon's own castle.</p>

<p>That suggests more worrying possibilities.</p>
