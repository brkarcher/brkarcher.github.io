## X Legion

One of Cyre's Legions.

X Legion was the oldest active Legion at the time of the Mourning, and its history as a unit was legendary. During the last war alone, the X Legion was responsible for destroying three royal retinues:

* at the battle for Nathyr, 912 YK, a months-long siege culminated in an assault that led to the capture of Prince Dimthen,  
* at the Broken Ribs in 963 YK, King Kaius II perished with his army,  
* and at Marguul Pass in 972 YK, the 103rd Royal Redplumes were broken and King Boranel narrowly escaped back to Breland.  

The Legion owed part of its success to its Valenar auxiliaries. The deadly flanking charge of the Valenar heavy cavalry was a constant threat to any commander who dared commit forces to engage the legion infantry.
