## The King's Dark Lanterns

The King's Dark Lanterns are Breland's premiere intelligence force. As a branch of the King's Citadel, the Lanterns are sworn in service directly to King Boranel irâ€™Wynarn, but unlike their colleagues at the Citadel, every agent is sworn to serve until death.

The Dark Lanterns are vested with the authority to operate in foreign territory with a high degree of autonomy, and their skill at undercover work is famed and despised by their rivals.

It is rumored that every agent is licensed to kill at their sole discretion.
