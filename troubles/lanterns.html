	<body><h2>The King's Dark Lanterns</h2>

<p>The King's Dark Lanterns are Breland's premiere intelligence force. As a branch of the King's Citadel, the Lanterns are sworn in service directly to King Boranel irâ€™Wynarn, but unlike their colleagues at the Citadel, every agent is sworn to serve until death.</p>

<p>The Dark Lanterns are vested with the authority to operate in foreign territory with a high degree of autonomy, and their skill at undercover work is famed and despised by their rivals.</p>

<p>It is rumored that every agent is licensed to kill at their sole discretion.</p>
