	<body><h2>Karl Arnsson</h2>

<p>Steward and Majordomo of Axe-head Keep in Port Verge. Has held the position for, essentially, as long as anyone can remember.</p>

<p>As befitting a member of Prince Kolberkon's staff, Arnsson is unfailingly polite... but also corrupt and selfish. He has amassed quite a bit of personal wealth, spent with a free hand on the finer things in life, by (ahem) creating a market for access to the business flowing through Kolberkon's estate.</p>
