## Prince Kolberkon

Prince of the Diresharks, ruling out of Port Verge.

Kolberkon himself is an outsider, a merchant-marine-kingpin-turned-warrior from Thrane who is loquacious in manner and expensive in tastes, in sharp contrast to his subjects. The people of Questor are generally seen as a terse, hard, warlike people, and the Diresharks themselves are famed as brutal, dreadfully effective raiders.

But each time a Direshark captain steps up to challenge Kolberkon to rites of combat or press legal or traditional claims to his throne, Kolberkon deflects it. His wit is too keen, his allies too numerous, and his luck too dumb, and so he has sat upon the Direshark high throne for 16 years.
