	<body><h2>Clansman</h2>

<p>A Boromar Clan cutter. A ship this size is ideal for operating in defiance of law enforcement; it is relatively fast for a shallow-water ship but also capable of retreating into the open sea, it's low-profile and requires a small crew, and with a little extra manpower it can even be hidden on land.</p>

<p>This one was sunk by the <em>Crown of Mishann</em> on 25 Zarantyr, 998.</p>
