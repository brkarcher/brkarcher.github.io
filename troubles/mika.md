> A small longship rows out to meet you as you approach the southern tip of the island, and with your permission the harbor pilot boards, a massive woman wearing an iron half-helm, a bastard sword, and a heavy blue cloak. She guides you through surprisingly dangerous waters to the, north around the north end of the island, and to a berth in the dead middle of the port. As your crew secures the ship to the pier, she turns to Captain Thorpe.

A harbor pilot at Port Verge who led the Crown into berth on Zarantyr 11. Gruff but willing to entertain questions about the city and its visitors. Seems to be affiliated with the Diresharks themselves.
