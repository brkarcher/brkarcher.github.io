## Regalport

> Regalport is the largest city you have been in in a long time. Several stone towers, each old and storied, stand up above a mass of buildings, domed and sloped, creating a sawtoothed silhouette that rises to meet you from out of the pelting winds and rain. And before that, a great forest of masts, spars, and furled sails dominates your vision. There is practically an armada at berth here, rolling and teetering with the storm.

> The city smells of pine and salt, and the wide boulevards here are clean and well lit by soft orange everburning lanterns that hang over major intersections. A fair number of people walk the streets despite the heavy rain—sailors, pirates, well-clothed local professionals, laborers, everything.

Regalport is the largest city in the Lhazaar Principalities and, by virtue of being Rygar ir'Wynarn 's home port, is its center of political power.

Compared to the great cities of Khorvaire's mainland, Regalport is quite young. To be sure, some settlement or another—Q'Barran raiders, Sarlonan colonists, Karrnathi exiles—has always taken advantage of the well-sheltered harbor on the east side of the fertile island of Greentarn, but none have been more than outposts on the margins of society.

As with all things, that changed with the Last War.

As Karrnathi and Cyran spheres of influence began to erode during the last few desperate decades of the war, pirates and petty sea lords stepped into the power vacuum. Most had few ambitions beyond their little islands and flagships, but there were several notable exceptions, among them Rygar ir'Wynarn, Lord of Greentarn. Young, vigorous, and insightful, he forged alliances with smaller sea lords, the Q'Barran colonies, and transient local powers, funneling their commerce through Regalport and establishing the city as a center of reliable, respectable trade. Regalport grew to accommodate nearly anybody seeking their fortune in Lhazaar, and today much of the mercantile wealth of the principalities passes through.

Regalport's eminence was formalized with the Treaty of Thronehold. Rygar was able to claim a seat at the diplomatic table for himself, and in doing so, ensured that anybody in the Principalities who seeks access to power must come to his throne.

The city itself is dominated by several small, ancient stone towers—it is said that one was built by Lhazaar herself—and the newest addition, Seadragon's Roost, a formidable fortress built by Rygar. The hill is known as Topside, and plays host to the majority of Regalport's (dazzlingly diverse) population. It looks over Dockside, home to the city's industry, as well as its famed Seafarer's Guild and the Church of the Silver Flame. Finally, the wealth of the city, when not clumped around Seadragon's Roost, can be found west of Dockside, in an area known as Seaside.

House Thuranni, one of the two rival Houses of Shadow, has a major enclave in Seaside, the House of Easterly Breeze.
