	<body><h2>XLVII Legion</h2>

<p>An organization of Cyrans who act, in secret, on behalf of their former country.</p>

<p>XLVII Legion was founded by Legate Reinhard ir'Norhen, commanding officer of the storied XV Legion. The XV Legion was in the field in Karrnath at the time of the Mourning, and Reinhard maneuvered his army to Thrane to surrender. Shortly after Thrane released him, he disguised himself as a shoemaker and began to contact former comrades and sympathetic contacts to organize the XLVII Legion.</p>

<p>Reinhard continues to serve as the legion's Legate, although the current nature of the legion's operations have the effect of diminishing the importance of the position. The legion is currently engaged in building roots, gathering information, marshaling resources, recruiting powerful allies, and, most importantly, searching for any possible way to turn back the Mourning. The nature of this work is quite distributed, and as such, the current legionaries operate with broad autonomy and in deep isolation. They exchange encoded missives by magical and mundane means, peer-to-peer, with very little in the way of centralized activity.</p>

<p>The XLVII Legion of 998 YK is small, at 26 members, but it has a growing political divide within its ranks. The dominant voice for the last two years has been the Royalists, who steer the organization toward the restoration of the Cyran monarchy. Ironically, Prince Oargev is one of their greatest political obstacles, as he has little ambition to carve out and claim a throne. The remainder of the legionaries are, collectively, the Radicals, who wish to establish a merchant republic: currently, Q'Barra is where they believe it may be done. The Radicals also envision a change in operating procedure, where the legion is made public and its membership extended to include any Cyran fit and willing.</p>

<p>Captain Tyrn recounts 26 current members, and he divides them into four groups. First, former Cyran military luminaries:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Legate Reinhard ir'Norhen</strong>, a 50-year-old human. A great and storied swordsman in his prime, then a decorated battlefield commander and war strategist. Former Legate of XV Legion.</li>
<li><strong>Legate Seth ir'Gawaine</strong>, a 52-year-old human. Bears the Gawaine family name but is quite distant from the heart of the family's wealth and power. Had a fine career as Legate of the XXI Legion, but was most widely known as a formidable war wizard.</li>
<li><strong>Legate Joda ir'Lethansel</strong>, a 52-year-old human. Legate of the legendary X Legion, the oldest and most famous legion active at the time of the Mourning. Had dedicated her life to the X Legion from a very young age, first as a centurion and then as a Tribune and finally as a Legate.</li>
<li><strong>Tribune Momoa Southwind</strong>, a 60-year-old half-elf. One of Joda's trusted centurions in the X Legion and an equestrian with few equals. Led the X Legion's Valenar auxiliaries in the famous cavalry charge at the Broken Ribs, resulting in the total destruction of Kaius II's forces.</li>
<li><strong>Centurion Phan Mak</strong>, a 26-year-old half-orc. Less well-decorated than most of his peers in the XLVII Legion, but was initiated as a member on the recommendations of Reinhard and Joda. Held command of the Half-Moon Auxiliaries of the XV Legion for a short time leading up to the Mourning: a tremendous task for such a young leader.</li>
<li><strong>Prefect Phosphor</strong>, an early model warforged, around 30 years old. Among the first of the warforged to be placed in a position of command anywhere in Khorvaire, overseeing all training in the XXIII Legion.</li>
<li><strong>Quintus the Red</strong>, a 62-year-old dwarf and an auxiliary in the XV Legion. Saved Phan Mak's life in a fight with a well-placed arrow, and the two have been inseparable since.</li>
<li><strong>Recanta Kile</strong>, a 23-year-old human and a soldier in the XIV Legion. The XIV Legion was destroyed in the Mourning, but Recanta had been recovering in a battlefield hospital in Thrane. Accepted into XLVII Legion after volunteering for several extremely dangerous "favors" for Reinhard as he established the legion.</li>
<li><strong>Geoff Dunnery</strong>, a 33-year-old human and a soldier in the X Legion. An average soldier of no particular renown for most of his career, he led a prison breakout in Karrnath shortly after the end of the war that freed dozens of former members of the X Legion who had been long thought dead.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second group is of former Cyran religious figures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Priest Myra</strong>, a 61-year-old human and a high-ranking devotee of Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Wealth. Unusually, Myra is not particularly skilled with divine magic; however, she is a brilliant administrator... and since the Mourning, has become a skilled embezzler on behalf of the XLVII Legion.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinator Doff</strong>, a 48-year-old human and high-ranking devotee of Aureon. Famed paladin, celebrated sword of justice, honored protector of the downtrodden; worthy of all these accolades and then some.</li>
<li><strong>Priest Lem</strong>, a 30-year-old human and a priest of Onatar. Affiliated with a smithy in Sharn and is an accomplished craftsman in his own right.</li>
<li><strong>Priest Ki</strong>, a human priest of Balinor (age unknown, though Tyrn suspects she may be among the oldest of the legionaries). A druid of vast power. Because of deeply-held religious beliefs, she does not honor most customary military or hereditary titles or greetings (nor most forms of class distinction, for that matter), which would be cause for irritation for quite a few of her fellow legionaries were it not for her devotion to the cause of Cyre's lost people.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third group consists of Cyran commoners:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sibelus Erstwick</strong>, a 26-year-old human. Undersecretary to a magistrate in eastern Cyre, Sibelus developed considerable skills as an organizer, administrator, and even as a "battlefield commander" during his tenure as undersecretary, as the province was constantly contending with Valenar raiding parties and receiving little help from the overstretched legions. A middling swordsman on his own, but a capable mind.</li>
<li><strong>Forallus Erstwick</strong>, a 28-year-old human and brother to Sibelus. A barrister in eastern Cyre, sharing in his brother's sharp mind and problem-solving initiative. He gained his family membership in the XLVII Legion by seeking out Cyrans after the Mourning, finding Reinhard, and volunteering them as spies in western Valenar.</li>
<li><strong>Elias Erstwick-Kan</strong>, a 27-year-old human and partner to Forallus. A magewright by trade with a hidden knack for tactics and strategy. Killed a man with a dagger, once, and decided he would rather not have to do it again.</li>
<li><strong>Seira Jonn</strong>, a 28-year-old human. A cooper in northern Cyre, she earned a reputation by leading a group of Cyran refugees out of the spreading mists of the Mourning, into Karrnath and along a treacherous path down  the Cyre river to avoid marching Karrnathi legions until reaching the safety of Gatherhold.</li>
<li><strong>Loryn Shonum</strong>, a 32-year-old human. Tyrn recruited him directly out of a Brelish prison to help commandeer the <em>Javelin</em> at port. Left the crew eventually—he was a much, much better swordsman than he was a sailor—but kept in touch.</li>
<li><strong>Captain Loghan Tyrn</strong>, a 37-year-old human. A former member of the XXXV Legion, stranded in Breland when the Legion was destroyed in battle. Organized a crew of saboteurs and captured the Brelish warship <em>Javelin</em> at port and sailed it to Seaside, where he was awarded a letter of marque and became a Cyran privateer.</li>
<li><strong>Captain Liam Arazka</strong>, a 35-year-old human. A notorious pirate with a killer instinct and a battle cunning. Was awarded a letter of marque and a knighthood in the Order of Old Galifar for rescuing the queen's sister, Elyana ir'Wynarn, from a Brelish prison on the Hilt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last group consists of non-Cyrans who have earned the trust of the Legion and have elected to serve it:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>William "Steelwill" Dedofan</strong>, a late model warforged, likely no older than 5. Left the service of Karrnath to live a solitary life on the eastern edge of the Mournlands. Came to the aid of Seira and her refugees, and shortly after she entered the service of the Legion, she recommended him as a legionary.</li>
<li><strong>Olev Nythis</strong>, a 70-year-old halfling Bishop of the Silver Flame. Originally came into contact with Reinhard as a kindly benefactor who extended some of the resources of the Church to come to the aid of displaced Cyrans, but began to gradually sense the true nature of Reinhard's organization and convinced Reinhard to allow him to help more fully.</li>
<li><strong>Ykar ir'Wynarn</strong>, a 40-year-old human member of the Karrnathi royal family who was betrothed to a Cyran princess just before the last phase of the war broke out and shattered hope that a lasting alliance would be formed. Bears a great deal of ill will toward his family... which is understandable, all things considered. Like many noble scions, is a capable swordsman, administrator, and diplomat.</li>
<li><strong>Magella Qindi</strong>, a 120-year-old Valenar half-elf. Warlord of Zephyr Keep. A reserve commander in one of the most decorated Valenar mercenary companies, the Vashtaer Suliunar, Magella's company was attached to the X Legion as an auxiliary. She was disgusted with the Valenar defection and served as a spy for Cyre.</li>
<li><strong>Daershaak</strong>, Cold Sun of Gold, a 14-year-old lizardfolk tribeswoman in Q'Barra. Has been in contact with the Erstwick family to attempt to broker a lasting peace with the settlers of Hope and possibly establish a safe new home for displaced Cyrans. Very young, but clever and ambitious.</li>
<li><strong>Lora d'Cannith</strong>, a 30-year-old human. A decorated craftsman of Cannith House South, deeply moved by the Mourning and has spent every waking moment since then working on projects to reclaim the lost Forgeholds or undo the Mourning. It seemed inevitable that she would cross paths with the Legion.</li>
