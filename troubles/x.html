	<body><h2>X Legion</h2>

<p>One of Cyre's Legions.</p>

<p>X Legion was the oldest active Legion at the time of the Mourning, and its history as a unit was legendary. During the last war alone, the X Legion was responsible for destroying three royal retinues:</p>

<ul>
<li>at the battle for Nathyr, 912 YK, a months-long siege culminated in an assault that led to the capture of Prince Dimthen,  </li>
<li>at the Broken Ribs in 963 YK, King Kaius II perished with his army,  </li>
<li>and at Marguul Pass in 972 YK, the 103rd Royal Redplumes were broken and King Boranel narrowly escaped back to Breland.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Legion owed part of its success to its Valenar auxiliaries. The deadly flanking charge of the Valenar heavy cavalry was a constant threat to any commander who dared commit forces to engage the legion infantry.</p>
