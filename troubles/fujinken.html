<p>This is an enormous longbow crafted of an exotic wood and enchanted with powerful magic. The grip is etched such that three characters stand out in relief, leaving their mark on the weilder's palm: 風神拳, for <em>Fūjinken</em>, or <em>Wind-god's Fist</em>.</p>

<p>The operation of the bow requires three actions. First, the steel spike at the bottom is meant to be planted into the ground, and the enchantment allows this to be done in almost any surface as an action. Grips inlaid on the limbs are meant for another person stand and grip with both hands, which consumes their action. Finally, the wielder may nock and fire an arrow. All three actions may be completed in one round, or the bow may be planted ahead of time, leaving two people to grip and fire the bow together on a later round.</p>

<p>Removing the bow from the ground is, likewise, an action.</p>

<p>When fired, the bow is a +1 bow that does 8d8 thunder damage in addition to 1d10+1 piercing damage.</p>
