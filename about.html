	<body><h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi!  I'm Ben.  If you're reading this, you probably know me, but even if you don't, you're welcome to snoop around.</p>

<p>This is where I keep my stuff.  Some of it is several years old.  Some of it might even be just a few months old!  The writing is all my own, and yes, some of it is terribly flawed, and not just in the way artists are their own harshest critics, yadda yadda... no, I mean that there's some downright lazy composition and dismally tropey stories wedged in with the stuff I'm actually really proud of.  But I keep that bad stuff around anyway, because it usually has some redeeming qualities to it.</p>

<p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/thesignbit">@thesignbit</a> on Twitter if you'd like to contact me.</p>
