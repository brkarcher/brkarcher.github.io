# The City: TL;DR

## Geography

The City is vast, covering roughly 200 square miles of land in dense construction.  Most permanent residences are confined within the tall, solid city walls.  A network of gated walls cuts through the city, partially separating districts.

The city center, called Apex, is the wealthiest fifteen square miles of the city.  West of Apex is Tarcken, the next-oldest region of the city.  Newcomers find the streets to be meandering and confusing.  To the west of Tarcken, beyond a wall called the Doomwall, lies the West Quarter, a broad swath of ruined city inhabited by the hungry, roaming undead.  Upon the ridge south of Apex and east of Tarcken is Masonrise.  What sets Masonrise apart from the rest of the city are the homes of The Guild and the Council of Light and Honor.  East of Apex are the twin boroughs of Schwarzstadt (Black City) and Eldeim.  Very few of the people in Schwarzstadt or Eldeim are wealthy; most are common laborers or craftsmen.  A little over half of the population of The City resides in Schwarzstadt and Eldeim.  Bordering on Eldeim (to the north) and Masonrise (to the west) is Redgale.  Most of the city's recent migrants live in Redgale.

### The Wilds

The City is an island in a sea of farmland.  Beyond that sea, The Wilds are an expansive, uncharted realm of dark forests, misty bogs, and wind-swept plains.

### The Undercity

Beneath the cobble streets of the city, especially in Apex and Tarcken, lie forgotten relics of the city's architectural past.

### The Thieves' Highway

Rooftops, with their lack of traffic and preponderance of chimneys, balconies, overhangs, and banners to hide behind, make the perfect avenue and the perfect getaway.

## Society

### Languages

The major languages spoken in The City, in order of prevalence, are Kingsmannen, "Footstep," Aldruthi, and Elven.

Kingsmannen was made the official language of King Altrecht's realm immediately following his conquests, and has functioned since as the primary language of The City.  "Footstep" is the nickname given to a hodgepodge of slang and loanwords borrowed from every conceivable language and used by quite a few of The City's localsâ€”and many of its criminals.  Aldruthi is another human dialect.  Speaking it is a surefire way to earn the distrust of anybody within earshot, for it is a language of the Wilds.  Finally, High Elven is spoken amongst the Barons and Count while entertaining.

### Races

The City is mostly human.  The nobility is entirely so, with the exception of a few notable Barons.

Of the non-human races, the most prolific are dwarves, half-orcs, half-elves, and elves, in that order.

* Dwarves are best represented in the merchant classes in the city.  
* Most of the elves, half-elves, and half-orcs in the city have some familial connection, recent or distant, to the Wilds.  
* The vast majority of all half-elves and half-orcs in The City are second-generation arrivals in The City.

#### Other Races

* Most elves of the City hail or descend from the peoples of the Wilds ("wood elves"), but a few claim not to.  They speak High Elven and call themselves the Talunos.  
* Halflings are something of a misunderstood group of people in the City.  They are quite prevalent in the world, settling in hamlets and villages all over, and they have a strong culture of multilinguism wherever they are found.  
* lol Gnomes.  
* Tieflings number few in the City.  The reasons given for their heritage are many and varied.  
* Dragonborn number even fewer.  Despite being spread across the city, they form a tight-knit community.  

### Governance

The most common noble titles are those of Knight and Baron.  The Knights control fiefs in the city bestowed by the Barons and collect taxes and levies from the peasants that live on those fiefs.  The Barons own the vast majority of the land in and around the city, pledging them as fiefs to the Knights in exchange for the promise that the Knight shall answer when the King calls upon the Baron to fight.  Finally, at the top of the heap is Lord Count Suttgart.

The Knights, as a result, have the most direct effect over the lives of The City's citizens.

Finally, the Throne of the Northern Reach still resides in the King's castle in the very heart of Apex, currently occupied by King Kalwurz II, an heirless man of thirty.

### Economy

Every fief has its share of cobblers, masons, carpenters, innkeeps, and tailors.  But each district in the city is said to have its own character.

The bulk of The City's "exports" are the tools and equipment necessary to farm the vast tracts of arable land beyond its walls.  Following that, The City exports culture and military gear to the various other (much smaller) cities in the Northern Reaches.

### Religion

#### Light And Honor

The Council of Light and Honor is the body that governs the joint efforts of the temples of Pelor, Ioun, and Heironeous.  Each of the three temples retains their own clergy and hierarchy, maintains their own shrines, and preaches to their own followers, but at noon on the thirtieth day of each month, they convene a council.

#### The Old Way

By an official definition agreed upon by the first meeting of the Council of Light and Honor, the term has come to mean ancestor worship, druidism, animal sacrifice, unsanctioned divinations, soothsaying, trafficking with demons, and an assortment of antiquated (and taboo) arcane disciplines.  This, of course, is muddy water.  The Old Way is considered a Heresy to the Temples of Light and Honor, though the temples have not been able to agree on the punishments warranted.

## Secret Society

### Midnight Oil

The Midnight Oil is the oldest "secret" organization in The City.  It is a vigilante group that protects the "common citizen" by hunting down "predators."

### The Guild

The Guild is a business venture, headquartered in Masonrise, capable of providing almost anything that could be asked for in exchange for money.  The less-than-legitimate aspects of the enterprise are never officially acknowledged.
